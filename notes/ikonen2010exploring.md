# ikonen2010exploring Exploring the Sources of Waste in Kanban Software Development Projects

## Intro

- One key trait of lean is waste reduction

## Wastes and theirs sources

### Partially done work

- delays in the critical path
- to implement a task required another, yet unimplemented task

### Extra processes

- some Kanban-based routines unneces- sary for tiny tasks
- inefficient retrospective meetings

### Extra features

- unawareness of the key requirements

### Task switching

- two tasks need each other in the im- plementation phase
- disruptions: helping other people or contributing other tasks
- avoidance of waiting: utilizing the waiting time by doing other tasks

### Waiting

- for customer representatives
- for IT support
- for hardware shipments for the project
- a person occupied when someone needs assistance

### Motion

- lack of communication

### Defects

- defects found at last-minute

## Findings

- It can be argued that the more waste a team produces the less chance of success it has
- It is argued that waste represents elements that restrain progress of projects
- Zero waste is not a requirement for project success


- Kanban is useful in attempting to minimize the impact of waste
- Be applying kanban, attention to the following must be paid regularly
  - delays in the critical path
  - optimizing board functioning for large and small tasks
  - elimination of inefficient methods
  - more informative customer cooperation to increase awareness of needs
  - clarification of sharing information

- There is a dependency between task switching and waiting
  - Members have to wait when unable to proceed
  - This time is used for other tasks to be more efficient
