## Summary of activity theory

1. Prime unit of analysis: an activity system seen in its relations to other activity systems
- collective
- artifact-mediated
- object-oriented
- reproduce themselves by generating actions (individual and group) and operations (automatic)

2. Multi-voicedness
- multiple points of view, traditions, interests
- division of labort creates different positions
- participants carry their own histories
- system itself carries multiple layers of history: artifacts, rules, conventions
- a source of trouble and innovation: requires translation and negotiation

3. Historicity
- systems take shape and get transformed over periods of time
- studied as local history of the activity and its objects
- history of ideas and tools that shaped the activity

4. Contradictions as sources of change
- not the same as problems or conflicts
- historically accumulating structural tensions
- within and between value systems
- contradictions generate disturbances and conflicts
- also generate innovative attempts to change the activity

5. Possibility of expansive transformations
- relatively long cycles of qualitative transformations
- questioning and deviating from established norms after aggravation of contradictions
- object and motive of activity may be reconceptualized for a wider array of possibilities
- a collective journey through the *zone of proximal development*
