- literature review

## Intro

Definition: We define CI more generally as a culture of sustained improvement targeting the elimination of waste in all systems and processes of an organization.

- It involves everyone working together to make improvements without necessarily making huge capital investments.
- CI can occur through evolutionary improvement, in which case improvements are incremental, or though radical changes that take place as a result of an innovative idea or new technology
- Often, major improvements take place over time as a result of numerous incremental improvements.

## CI Methodologies

- Developed based on a basic concept of quality or process improvement, or both, in order to reduce waste, simplify the production line and improve quality
- Best known:
  - lean manufacturing
  - six sigma
  - balanced scorecard
  - lean six sigma

## Existing research

Three types of kaizen:
- management-oriented: focuses on company strategy and involves everyone in the company
- group-oriented kaizen: best represented by quality circles, which require employees to form a team with the goal of finding and solving problems faced during their day-to-day work without interference from management
- individual-oriented kaizen: derived from bottom-up design, workers make recommendations on a problem being faced
