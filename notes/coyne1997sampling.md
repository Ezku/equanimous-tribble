## SELECTIVE AND PURPOSEFUL SAMPLING

selective sampling is a practical necessity

after several observation visits to the sites, the researcher will know who to sample for the purpose of the study

as the study progresses, new categories may be discovered which would lead the researcher to more sampling in that particular dimension.

## THEORETICAL SAMPLING

Theoretical sampling seems to have originated with the discovery of grounded theory, which was first developed by the sociologists Glaser & Strauss in 1967

Glaser (1978) defines theoretical sampling as ‘the process of data collection for generating theory whereby the analyst jointly collects, codes, and analyses his data and decides which data to collect next and where to find them, in order to develop his theory as it emerges. This process of data collection is controlled by the emerging theory, whether substantative or formal’

The researcher must have some idea of where to sample, not necessarily what to sample for, and where it will lead.

### Sampling according to the dictates of the emerging theory


Theoretical sampling is the process of data collection whereby the researcher simultaneously collects, codes and analyses the data in order to decide what data to collect next.

Deciding where to sample next according to the emerging codes and categories is theoretical sampling.


‘when the strategies of theoretical sampling are employed, the researcher can make shifts of plan and emphasis early in the research process so that the data gathered reflects what is occurring in the field rather than speculation about what cannot or should have been observed’
