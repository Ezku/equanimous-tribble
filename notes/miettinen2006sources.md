# miettinen2006sources The sources of novelty

## Introduction

## From individual psychology to a cultural and systemic view of creativity

## Contradictions and functional failures of practices as a driving force of creation

Sources of change in socio-technical practices:
- critical problems: "functional failures" (Hughes 1978)
- problems retarding technological or industrial change
- likely to be solved by invention, at least in the opinion of the inventor (Hughes 1978)
- "the formulation of a critical problem already implies the possibility and direction of the solution"

Crisis or failure of a practice as a source of change and novelty:
- suggested by various philosophical and psychological research traditions
- pragmatism: Dewey (1938/1991)
  - in a changing world, habits often don't work or are faced with difficulty
  - conscious reflection is needed
  - leads to workation of hypotheses for reconstruction
- cultural historical activity theory:
  - based on cultural mediation
  - the relationship between subject and environment is mediated by signs and tools (Vygotsky 1979)
  - "unit of analysis in studying human mediated activity is an activity system" (Engeström, Miettinen, Punamäki 1999)
  - source of change: historically developed contradictions


### Developmental contradictions (Engeström 1987)

Need state:
- contradictions arise between elements of the activity system
- developing contradictions first arise as errors, disturbances and indeterminate discontent
- can be transformed into recognized problem by conscious reflection

Invention, or innovation, as a reaction to contradiction or imbalance in a practice
- development of new tools makes creation of new kinds of objects possible and _demands_ reorganization of work

## Distributed creation and the networks of innovation

## Contingency: the unanticipated intertwining of chains of events and the potential multi-usability of artefacts

## The possibility of management of creativity
