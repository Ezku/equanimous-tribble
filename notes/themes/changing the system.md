# Changing the system

Section \ref{rise-of-agile-and-lean} mentions that a key part of the lean perspective to software development is the fact that it describes principles for improving, not ascribed ways of doing things.

In section \ref{capacity-for-reaction}, on the other hand, it was claimed that it might be prudent to inspect the role that dailies might take within a lean workflow.

If "changing the system", so to speak, is one way for an organization to become better at building software, and dailies are an event where new input to the system is considered, might this systematic, continuous improvement and dailies be related? What happens in dailies, really? How might a team know how to do things better after engaging in whatever goes on in there?

One key way for this improvement to happen is to inspect the flow of work items on a kanban board and change the system so that the flow smoothens and becomes more stable, predictable. As a visualization of the work, the kanban board is a description of the system the work occurs in, and changes to it should - in theory - reflect back to the system somehow.

Scrum literature describes per-sprint retrospectives intended for improving the process at great length; lean principles include *kaizen*, which is Japanese for continuous improvement.
