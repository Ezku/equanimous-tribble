# Process visualization makes dailies redundant

Here's a daily:

> What work items moved yesterday?
> What items are moving today?
> What items are blocked?

And here's the counterargument to that when your process visualization is adequate:

1. The difference between when today and yesterday in the visualization
2. Your methodology will tell you what's the most important thing to work on, given the visualization
3. The things that are marked as blocked

Given that an adequate process visualization is perfectly capable of addressing these three questions, you do not need to have a daily.
