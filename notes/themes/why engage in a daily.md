# Why engage in a daily?

Salilla tuli tämmönen mieleen:
- "Why would you have a daily?" Mullahan on tähän jo selitys ikään kuin from first principles, mutta laveesti. Ja se selitys on ihan täydellinen selittämään miksi pitää tuoda joku tiedonluonnillinen ymmärtämys mukaan tähän juttuun.
- "So the people engage in something that has no value in terms of software development work done, but is ostensibly so important that the people are willing to spend up to an hour at a time *per day* on it. The only reasonable hypothesis would be that the development of the software is somehow made better through this: that there's some means, some knowledge that is gained through the engaging in a daily that at least plausibly more than makes up for the time spent."
- "It must be that the team itself has this hypothesis, or it would not have dailies. That would be deliberately wasteful. Let us therefore assume that the team indeed believes this. What they do not have is a description of *how* the daily is of value. We would therefore like to come up with a way to describe the daily as a recurring event where knowledge is produced, made better or different in some way."
