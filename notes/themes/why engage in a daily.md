# Why engage in a daily?

Salilla tuli tämmönen mieleen:
- "Why would you have a daily?" Mullahan on tähän jo selitys ikään kuin from first principles, mutta laveesti. Ja se selitys on ihan täydellinen selittämään miksi pitää tuoda joku tiedonluonnillinen ymmärtämys mukaan tähän juttuun.
- "So the people engage in something that has no value in terms of software development work done, but is ostensibly so important that the people are willing to spend up to an hour at a time *per day* on it. The only reasonable hypothesis would be that the development of the software is somehow made better through this: that there's some means, some knowledge that is gained through the engaging in a daily that at least plausibly more than makes up for the time spent."
- "It must be that the team itself has this hypothesis, or it would not have dailies. That would be deliberately wasteful. Let us therefore assume that the team indeed believes this. What they do not have is a description of *how* the daily is of value. We would therefore like to come up with a way to describe the daily as a recurring event where knowledge is produced, made better or different in some way."

Tässä nyt kuvataan sitä *what is at stake*

--> tää ajatus meni sisään introductioniin

How do contradictions between activity systems manifest in a daily?
- we can describe the daily in an activity system in a network of related activity systems, where the practice of a daily may enable reconciliation of tensions inherent in the multitude of perspectives involved in the creation of software

Between what elements of the activity system do the contradictions arise?


in the inbox section the team attempts to find answers to these questions:
- is this a thing we must do (decision making, commitment)
  - "wishlist", "bounced", "needs discussion" vs other boards
- when will this need to be done (timeliness)
  - immediately? (fires)
  - after planning for it? (cycles / continuum backlog priorization)
- how will we do it? (modelling)
  - after deciding what needs to be done, can we reach an acceptable modelling of the decision with the structure currently in place?


Vygotsky's double stimulation (1978)


- Daily 03 (?): needs of QA versus need to ship
- Joku toinen daily myös: inbox splitting, knowledge sharing


## Empirically...

### 04

Things that stand out in discussion -- WHAT KINDS OF THINGS GET ANSWERED AND RESOLVED:
- Can I observe the outcome of what was done?
- How important is this thing in contrast to other things?
- Who would be able to work on this thing?
- Who is working on it right now / who is the next to work on the thing?

### 05

- "There's work to be done I can't handle"
- Who's the best to do this? (Gets debated even!)
- Time criticality: When does this need to get done?
- Requests for help, handovers
- Explanations of inquiries undertaken (rnd, debugging?)
- Impededness, hinderances to work

## Findingseista pelastettua:


Questions to start with:

- What 'subpractices' can we observe to constitute the daily practice?
- How are other practices represented within this practice? Can we for instance categorise segments based on their relation to other practices?
  - Ref notes on theme: "Why do you engage in this? Why is the inbox important?"
- How does the team reconcile the boundaries to outside practices?
  - What kinds of conflicts or tensions can we observe?
