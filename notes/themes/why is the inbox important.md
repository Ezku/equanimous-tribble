"Why do you engage in this? Why is the inbox important?"
- This is explicitly brushed upon by the practitioners themselves. On one occasion, the role of inbox pruning as a collective knowledge sharing device is raised as a point of discussion. A counterpoint argues that there is no knowledge to be gained by acknowledging that there is nothing to be done about a specific item by the team as a whole and that whoever passed the input should have now that to be the case (*need quote*, keywords: knowledge).
- On another occasion it is argued whether the inbox should be split: on things that it would be known that the team can take action and that there's value in handling collectively, and correspondingly on input to specific subteams working on specific parts of the software platform. However, a conclusion was reached where it was held to be of negative value to parties *outside* a team to be required to know "which part of the platform" an issue belonged to. Outsiders would have difficulty to distinguish different parts from each other, because they would not have the capacity to make those distinguishments due to not working within the practice. (*need quote*, keywords: how do we split inbox)
- On yet another occasion, regrettably outside the scope of the empirical study but discussed here anecdotally, the researcher witnessed a discussion in which a team member who could throughout the study have been interpreted as detached and uninvolved in dailies questioned the need to spend such amounts of time on the inbox every day with the whole team. According to the researcher's memory, the situation was resolved without change to the inbox practice, but this obviously can't shown. However, this points to a few interesting possibilities, one of which must have been true.
  1. Value was seen in the continuing of the inbox pruning practice. Maybe some participants did not, but some must have, or the intervention would have called this to attention.
  2. A direct challenge against a practice is not a sufficient condition for the team as a whole to change it, even if individually they do not see value in it.
- So if not this way, how does change happen? What is the vehicle of change? Can we approach an answer to that from the empirical material?

 Boundary objects can, of course, be a center of intense conflict as easily as one of coopera- tive effort.
. Creating and reshaping boundary objects is an exercise of power that can be collaborative or unilateral
