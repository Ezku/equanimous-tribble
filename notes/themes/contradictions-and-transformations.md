# Contradictions and transformations

## Innovation

### Activity-theoretical view on innovations (kerosuo2010promoting)

Activity-theoretical view:
- general paradigm to study transformations and social processes
- innovation through expansive learning

### Novelty (miettinen2006sources)

Sources of change in socio-technical practices:
- critical problems: "functional failures" (Hughes 1978)

Crisis or failure of a practice as a source of change and novelty:
- suggested by various philosophical and psychological research traditions
- pragmatism: Dewey (1938/1991)
  - in a changing world, habits often don't work or are faced with difficulty

### Developmental contradictions (Engeström 1987)

Need state:
- contradictions arise between elements of the activity system
- developing contradictions first arise as errors, disturbances and indeterminate discontent
- can be transformed into recognized problem by conscious reflection

## Contradictions

\citep{kerosuo2010promoting}
- "The creation of new practices, ie. the creation of social innovations, is a slow process"
- in order to understand the process of innovation, contradictions in the scrutinized activity and their transformations need to be understood

Contradiction: tension between opposing forces (Engeström 1987)
- drives change by generating tensions, disturbances, attempts for development
- contradictions emerge as historically accumulated structural tensions

## Transformations

Expansive transformations as different from eg. Carlile's transformation of knowledge

Theory of expansive learning (Engeström 1987)
- qualitative transformations in the process of innovation
- process of innovation is to be understood through contradictions and transformations

### Summary of activity theory (engestrom2001expansive)

5. Possibility of expansive transformations
- questioning and deviating from established norms after aggravation of contradictions
- a collective journey through the *zone of proximal development* (ref. Vygotsky, 1978?)

### Understanding knowing as a feature of cultural and historical activity systems (nicolini2003knowing)

Ongoing transformational drift
- fueled by the existence of paradoxes, tensions, incoherences in the nature of activity systems
- both the understanding of the nature of the object of work as well as the activities that go along with it are in constant expansion

Constant expansion
- **requires the activity system to learn new ways of accommodating all different composing elements**
- is bound to affect the very nature of the object of work and spur new inconsistencies and contradictions
- recursively triggers new cycles of transformation
