Knowing in Organizations: A Practice-Based Approach

## Introduction

### Understanding knowing as a feature of cultural and historical activity systems

Activities:
- culturally situated
- mediated by linguistic and technological artifacts
- always enacted in communities
- imply a division of labor among participants
- provide motives and are oriented toward objects of work that are partly given and partly generated within the activity itself

Activity systems
- are the units of analysis of the practice-as-activity approach
- comprise a variety of actions with different histories and logics of action associated with them
- always entail conflicting aspects and inherent contradictions
- are by definition disturbance-producing systems

Ongoing transformational drift
- fueled by the existence of paradoxes, tensions, incoherences in the nature of activity systems
- both the understanding of the nature of the object of work as well as the activities that go along with it are in constant expansion

Constant expansion
- **requires the activity system to learn new ways of accommodating all different composing elements**
- is bound to affect the very nature of the object of work and spur new inconsistencies and contradictions
- recursively triggers new cycles of transformation

Activity theory
- explains knowing as an aspect of collaborative endeavors that are social and transformational in character
- emphasizes that social and historical conditions are both the outcome of and the precondition for social activity

Practice as activity
- carries within itself the principles of both its perpetuation and its transformation
- highlights the mediated nature of activity and the central role played by artifacts both material and symbolic in actualizing conditions, structuring current and future endeavors
- emphasizes opportunities for innovation and development of collective competencies inherent in any practice
- can articulate the recursive relation between practice and its object

Cycle of mutual interaction
- The expansion of the object of the activity triggers the creation and emergence of anew mediating instrumentality that recursively reconstitutes the activity and its object
- is an endless process that creates new practices as well as new ways to address them

Expertise
: Collective
: Heterogenous
: Evolving phenomena

Organisations
: Distributed
: Decentered
: Emergent systems of practical knowledge

Mediating artifacts and objects
- organizing centers for regimes of practical expertise

*"The modification or emergence of new objects of work has the effect of bringing out the contradictions inherent in any activity system and requires the development of new rules, mediating artifacts and ways of working that will inevitably modify the object of work in an endless process"*


## Chapter 6: Organizing processes in complex activity networks

Central organizing processes
- perspective making
- perspective taking
- perspective shaping
- central in situations where different expert groups must cooperate in the pursuit of multiple, perhaps competing, objectives
- "approach applied in a study of three contrasting ad hoc teams convened to develop new approaches to business strategy"

Tsoukas 1996:
- knowledge of an organization is indeterminate and emergent
- knowledge cannot be controlled centrally
- knowledge partly originates from outside the organization

Activity theory
- "functional materialism"
- denies conventional assumption of abilities emerging independently from their settings (cultural, historical)
- human *capacities develop when people act upon their immediate surroundings*, in collaboration with others

Engeström's general model of "activity systems" (1987)
- relations between individuals and the object of their activity are mediated by concepts and technologies
- relationships between the community and the overall object of its activity are mediated by its division of labor
- relations between individuals and the communities of which they are a part are mediated by rules and procedures

Activity systems
- support goal attainment
- are disturbance-producing
- have incoherencies, inconsistencies, paradoxes and tensions as integral elements

Manifestations of disturbances
- people are evidently interpreting situations in different ways
- inherent dilemmas in the overall pattern of activity become clear
- unexpected difficulties emerge in the execution of day-to-day tasks

*"Relationships within activity systems are made orderly only by the determination people show as they engage with the objects of their activity. As disturbances become evident within and between activity systems, participants may begin to address underlying issues and to create new learning. As people change their situation they change their activities and, simultaneously, they change themselves."*

Activity theory problematizes
- what people are doing
- how and with whom they are doing it
- how collective learning may occur

Activity theory introduces the question
- how can people shape the contexts that shape their practices

Activity theory suggests a particular approach to research
- practices should be studies as transformative activity
- practices should be located within a broader analysis of their historical development
- by highlighting disturbances within activity systems researchers can help those they are studying to recognize, reflect and rebuild their activity systems


### How can activity theory adapted for organizational analysis?

*"As a general rule, the overall objects of the activity and patterns of collaboration in complex work organizations are typically difficult to see and to represent. They tend to be multiple, only loosely connected, emergent, abstract, and contestable."*


Communities of activity
- Rather than analyzing organizations as single activity systems, it is more satisfactory to analyze them as _networks_ of overlapping activity systems
- Units of such networks: communities of activity
- **Can be looselty defined in terms of the extent to which members recognize shared work priorities, work with a common cognitive and technological infrastructure, and support each other's activity**
- collaboration across different systems of activity raises issues concerning priorities, identities and operational methods as well as questions about relative authority and influence


Engeström's general model of activity systems: (\citep{engestrom1999activity}?)
- A community of activity
- Other communities with which it interacts
- The shared object of their endeavors

Terminology by Boland and Tenkasi (1995) \citep{boland1995perspective}:
- *Perspective making.* The different contributions that different communities of activity bring to the organization. Involves: **management of priorities**, infrastructure, and identity. Support "domain innovations" within particular expert communities.
- *Perspective taking.* Relations between communities of activity. Involves management of authority and influence, questions of priority and of relative identities. Support "boundary innovations" in the relationships between communities.
- *Perspective shaping.* Assumptions about context, achievements and possibilities. Involves management of imaginations, conceptual resources people bring to their activities, facilities they have for reflection. Support "contextual innovations".

### Notes

"Activity theory suggests that collective developments occur when, through their actions, people reinterpret their environment, rebuild their activities, and reconceive of themselves."

Why activity theory and not eg actor network theory?

"Like actor network theory, activity theory features ... factors associated with knowledge, power, and ordering processes. However, the emphasis it places on opportunities for innovation and the development of collective competencies contrasts with the emphasis in most actor network studies on fixed patterns of power and dominination" (Miettinen 1999?)
