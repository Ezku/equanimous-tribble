Knowing in Organizations: A Practice-Based Approach

## Introduction

### Understanding knowing as a feature of cultural and historical activity systems

Activities:
- culturally situated
- mediated by linguistic and technological artifacts
- always enacted in communities
- imply a division of labor among participants
- provide motives and are oriented toward objects of work that are partly given and partly generated within the activity itself

Activity systems
- are the units of analysis of the practice-as-activity approach
- comprise a variety of actions with different histories and logics of action associated with them
- always entail conflicting aspects and inherent contradictions
- are by definition disturbance-producing systems

Ongoing transformational drift
- fueled by the existence of paradoxes, tensions, incoherences in the nature of activity systems
- both the understanding of the nature of the object of work as well as the activities that go along with it are in constant expansion

Constant expansion
- **requires the activity system to learn new ways of accommodating all different composing elements**
- is bound to affect the very nature of the object of work and spur new inconsistencies and contradictions
- recursively triggers new cycles of transformation

Activity theory
- explains knowing as an aspect of collaborative endeavors that are social and transformational in character
- emphasizes that social and historical conditions are both the outcome of and the precondition for social activity

Practice as activity
- carries within itself the principles of both its perpetuation and its transformation
- highlights the mediated nature of activity and the central role played by artifacts both material and symbolic in actualizing conditions, structuring current and future endeavors
- emphasizes opportunities for innovation and development of collective competencies inherent in any practice
- can articulate the recursive relation between practice and its object

Cycle of mutual interaction
- The expansion of the object of the activity triggers the creation and emergence of anew mediating instrumentality that recursively reconstitutes the activity and its object
- is an endless process that creates new practices as well as new ways to address them

Expertise
: Collective
: Heterogenous
: Evolving phenomena

Organisations
: Distributed
: Decentered
: Emergent systems of practical knowledge

Mediating artifacts and objects
- organizing centers for regimes of practical expertise

*"The modification or emergence of new objects of work has the effect of bringing out the contradictions inherent in any activity system and requires the development of new rules, mediating artifacts and ways of working that will inevitably modify the object of work in an endless process"*
