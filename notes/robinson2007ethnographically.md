- Studies of practitioners in the setting of practice
- Focused on social interactions which arise as intrinsic part of the practice of developing software

- Understanding practice in its own terms
- Considering all activities as strange

Ethnography
- seeks to understand practice in its own terms, minimizing the impact of the researcher
- researchers attend to the taken-for-granted, accepted and unremarkable aspects of practice, deliberately considering all activities as *strange*
- no feature of practice is discounted a priori
- the totality of practice is studied, with all its messy characteristics

Ethnographically-informedness:
1.
- Essential nature of practice not known a priori
- Actuality of practice needs to be ascertained empirically by appropriate studies
- Research is not driven by hypotheses, but by research questions
2.
- real world, natural setting => aspiration not to disturb practice
- data collected through combination of methods (observation, interviews, discussion, study of artefacts), but no attempt to change practice during course of study
- avoid control, intrusion, experiment => all data is naturally occurring


-"It has become quite common to adapt ethno- graphic traditions in order to conduct shorter studies"
-"In keeping with these shortened approaches, our studies have not involved total immersion for several months"

Usefulness of approach:
- Cannot address questions based on hypotheses derived from theories
- 'How' and 'why' and 'what are the characteristics of'
- Capture rich interdependencies
- Understanding 'how' or 'why' allows considering consequences of change or removal of practice (eg. what if we modified our story cards)

Challenges
- Ethical issues concerning contracts & consent have been problematic
- If the researcher is part of the community of practice, how do would they be able to consider anything 'strange'? Both challenges and advantages.
- Tension involved in
    - moving between two worlds: understanding, yet considering strange
    - Need to be non-judgmental
- Benefits
    + acceptance by 'tribe'
    + not getting overwhelmed when following activity

"Practice should be disturbed as little as possible"
- No formal agreement documents
- "asking individuals for written consent would alter the relationship signiW- cantly making natural observation impossible"

Keeping rigour
- triangulation: using data from many different sources
- seeking disconfirmation: analyse data to check none of it refutes conclusions
- iterative development of understanding: present tentative findings, get feedback

Major driver
- Aspiration to improve practice
• uncover and elucidate problems and thereby delineate their solution spaces;
• challenge received views; and
• provide rich narrative accounts of practice.

Nature of findings:
- Problems and solutions
    - "There is no expectation that our answers provide direct solutions to speciWc problems."
    - "In some cases, we have uncovered problems, but investi- gation of the solutions lies outside our immediate study."
- Challenging received views
    + Knowing the actuality of software development practice, rather than the received view, is an essential prerequisite to the design of a tool, technique, or methodology to support that practice
    - "Challenging received views can inform and improve practice."
- Providing rich accounts of practice
    – "Such accounts thus provide practitioners with a mirror of their practice which might support their activities as ‘reXec- tive practitioners’"
