## Knowledge practices in design: the role of visual representations as 'epistemic objects'

Epistemic role of objects:
- Visual reprsentations are characterized by a 'lack' or incompleteness that precipitates unfolding

Visual representations:
- Meaningful to different stakeholders, eliciting their distinct contributions

*Unfolding ontology*:
- As project evolves, and drawings change, new issues and needs for knowledge work arise
- Objects constantly in flux
