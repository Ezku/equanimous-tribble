## Activity subsystems (Holt & Morris 1993) p.98-103

### Production subsystem
- primary focus of activity systems analysis is the top triangle
- consists of the objects that attempt to produce the outcome of the system
- production involves:
  - subject, object, tools, actions, operations (Nardi 1996)
  - interactions and relationships between the subject and object that are mediated by tools and signs
- concurrent with the production of objects, the subject is constructing knowledge about the activity, its components, assumptions and contradictions

### Consumption subsystem

- How the subject and the surrounding community collaborate to act on the object
- Represents a contradiction inherent in activity systems: goal is to transform an object, but production activities consume energy and resources (Holt & Morris 1993)

### Distribution subsystem

- Ties the object of activity to the community by defining a division of labor
- Divides up activities according to social laws or expectations

### Exchange subsystem

- Engages the subject, the rules that constrain the activity and the community with which the subject interacts
- Regulates the activities of the system in terms of personal needs
- The exchange of personal, social and cultural norms in any work community also determines the nature of the work culture and the climate for those involved in any activity system
- In exchange, norms are negotiated by members of the community and become the rules by which the activity system and subject regulate their performance
