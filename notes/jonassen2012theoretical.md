## Activity subsystems \citep{holt1993activity} p.98-103

### Production subsystem
- primary focus of activity systems analysis is the top triangle
- consists of the objects that attempt to produce the outcome of the system
- production involves:
  - subject, object, tools, actions, operations (Nardi 1996)
  - interactions and relationships between the subject and object that are mediated by tools and signs
- concurrent with the production of objects, the subject is constructing knowledge about the activity, its components, assumptions and contradictions

### Consumption subsystem

- How the subject and the surrounding community collaborate to act on the object
- Represents a contradiction inherent in activity systems: goal is to transform an object, but production activities consume energy and resources (Holt & Morris 1993)

### Distribution subsystem

- Ties the object of activity to the community by defining a division of labor
- Divides up activities according to social laws or expectations

### Exchange subsystem

- Engages the subject, the rules that constrain the activity and the community with which the subject interacts
- Regulates the activities of the system in terms of personal needs
- The exchange of personal, social and cultural norms in any work community also determines the nature of the work culture and the climate for those involved in any activity system
- In exchange, norms are negotiated by members of the community and become the rules by which the activity system and subject regulate their performance

## Methodological assumptions of activity theory p.110

- Descriptive tool rather than prescriptive
- Care must be taken in generalizing the descriptions

"Although Engeström believed that activity theory does not offer ready-made techniques or procedures for research, its widespread application as a lens for analyzing activity has yielded some generally accepted practices"

- The activity must be studied in real-life practice with researchers as active participants (Kuutti 1991)
- Necessitates a qualitative approach to analysis

Important for analysing learning situations:
- Time frame should be long enough to understand the objects of activity, changes in those objects over time and their relations to objects in other settings
- Analysts should pay attention first to broad patterns of activity before considering narrow episodic fragments that do not reveal the overall direction and importance of the activity
- Analysts should use varied data collection methods and points of view
