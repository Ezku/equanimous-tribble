## Intro

Challenges on work organizations:
- worldwide economic situation
- technological change
- market competition
- new customer demands
- problems related to production, competence, knowledge-intensive society

Meeting challenges is demanding:
- disruptive and multi-directional innovations required
(Freeman and Louca 2000, Perez 2003)

Consequence:
- need to redesign activity
- need to reconfigure capacity

Organisations not designed for promoting innovation (Leonard 1998)

First generation of knowledge management to be replaced by second generation:
- knowledge is embedded and constructed in collective practices
- knowledge is not an individual property, codifiable

Change laboratory: promoting innovation and learning (Engeström 1996)

Innovation: social processes (Slappendal 1996)

A new system of learning and learning practices required (Pihlaja 2005, Ahonen 2008)

Successful social processes of innovation can be enhanced through expansive learning (Engeström 1987)

## Activity-theoretical view on innovations

Activity-theoretical view:
- general paradigm to study transformations and social processes
- innovation through expansive learning

Derives from Soviet cultural psychology (Vygotsky 1978)

Theory of expansive learning (Engeström 1987)
- qualitative transformations in the process of innovation
- process of innovation from idea generation to implementation to diffusion
- process of innovation is to be understood through contradictions and transformations


"Different activities are distinguished by their objects"
- rarely understood the same way due to differing perspectives
- activities are often inherently multi-voiced
- this is a source of tension and contradictions

Activity-theoretical study intends to resolve these tensions by creating novel solutions
- multi-voicedness can become a source of innovation

### Human activity as an activity system (Engeström 1987)

The subject:
- focusing on an object of collective activity
Mediated by:
- signs and tools
- rules and division of labor in a community

Four sub-activities:
- production
- consumption
- exchange
- distribution

"The activity system model is often used as a unit that constitutes two or more activity systems"
- surgical unit = surgical activity and anesthetic activity
- together these activity systems provide the necessary and complementary cultural resources for the creation of novelty

Contradiction: tension between opposing forces (Engeström 1987)
- drives change by generating tensions, disturbances, attempts for development
- contradictions emerge as historically accumulated structural tensions

### Expansive learning actions (Engeström, Sannino 2010)

(Expansive learning cycle, Engeström 1999)

1. Questioning
- emergence of a state of need
- related to *primary contradictions* of an activity, usually latent

2. Double bind
- contradictions can become explicit through double binds
- experienced by single human beings
- psychological representatives of *secondary contradictions*
- act as drivers of change
- manifested between two elements of an activity system (eg, rules and object)

3. Analysis and modelling
- new object and motive
- new instruments

4. Examining and testing
- model and instruments adjusted

5. Implementing the model
- *tertiary contradictions* between old and new models of an activity may occur
- eg use of new tools can be resisted

6. Reflecting on the process
- evaluation and stabilization

7. Consolidation and generalization
- can trigger *quaternary contradictions* between the new activity and its neighboring activities

Of note: the steps of this process may be skipped or done in no specific order

## Change laboratory as a method for promoting innovations and learning within organisations

Techno-economic change requires adoption of context-specific forms of learning and development (Miettinen 2006)

Vygotsky's double stimulation (1978)
- primary stimuli: original task or problem ("mirror" in the change lab, videotaped performances, stories, feedback, statistics)
- secondary stimuli: theoretical models used as neutral objects or instruments

## Case example

Analyzing tensions and contradictions in a surgical unit
Finding solutions for analyzed tensions
Implement a new model

- Time limits instituted by new legislation
- Daily resources decreased
- Difficulties in hiring new staff
- Patients had become more demanding

Contradictory demands:
- long waiting lists, lack of resources

- Based on history and practices, anesthesia and surgery constituted two activity systems
Surgery: object is a patient in need, and a diagnosed part of body to be operated
Anesthesia: patient in need of anesthesia

- Tension between knowledge experienced by the practitioners and rationally justified knowledge

## Summary

Social process of innovation (Slappendal 1996):
- expansive learning actions
- contradictions and their transformations need to be analyzed and solved
- novelty and innovation need to be enabled

"Mirror" data
- enabled taking distance, allowing involvement in solving the contradictions involved
- contributing to the social process of innovation by modeling, imaging and projecting the effects of the new model

Expansive learning actions:
- ideal script for social process of innovation
- can be broken up and reformulated
- may seem unidirectional and deterministic
- results show it's not

Required in employee-driven innovations:
- strong intervention tools
- theoretical framework

"The creation of new practices, ie. the creation of social innovations, is a slow process"
- in order to understand the process of innovation, contradictions in the scrutinized activity and their transformations need to be understood
