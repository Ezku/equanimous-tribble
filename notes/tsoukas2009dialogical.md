## A Dialogical Approach to the Creation of New Knowledge in Organizations

- How is new knowledge created in organizations?
- Focus on direct social interaction

From a dialogical perspective:
- New knowledge originates in individual capacity to draw new distinctions concerning a task at hand
- New distinctions from practitioners experiencing situations in light of already constituted distinctions
- Articulation of new distinctions takes place when organization members engage in dialogical exchange

Dialogue:
- Leads to self-distanciation from subject
- Productivity depends on engaging relationally with others
- Relational engagement leads to taking responsibility for joint tasks and relationships

Self-distanciation => new distinctions:
- Conceptual combination
- Conceptual expansion
- Conceptual reframing

*New knowledge = intersubjectively accepted new distinctions*
