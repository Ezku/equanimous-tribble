##ï¿¼A Pragmatic View of Knowledge and Boundaries: Boundary Objects in New Product Development

Knowledge in new product development: *barrier to and source of innovation*

Knowledge in practice:
- localized, embedded and invested within a function
- problematic knowledge boundaries arise when working across functions

Boundary object:
- Means of representing, learning about, transforming knowledge to resolve consequences at boundary

## Introduction

- Recognition: Knowledge is a critical factor in creating competitive success over time
- Executing on this awareness is a challenge

Knowledge is difficult to manage:
- it's difficult to transfer
- it's sticky
- it has a tacit nature

Premise:
- Knowledge in organizations is problematic
- In new product development, knowledge is both a source of and a barrier to innovation

Knowledge boundaries:
- Characteristics of knowledge that drive innovative problem solving within a function actually hinder problem solving and knowledge creation across functions
- Specialized knowledge poses deep problems
- Boundaries are a critical challenge, but also a necessity
- Specialization of different kinds of knowledge is fundamental

Knowledge: localized, embedded, invested in practice
- working across functional boundaries difficult
- accommodating the knowledge developed in another practice especially so

## Three approaches to "knowledge boundaries"

Syntactic and semantic: capture current ways of thinking about knowledge and boundaries

Pragmatic: additional but complementary to the first two

### Syntactic: Processing of information is the primary concern

- Once a syntax is shared and stable, it is sufficient
- Information processing perspective of dealing with a boundary
- Highlights differences between degrees of uncertainty in environments on either side of boundary

Overall insights:
- More information is better, more communication is better, more team strategies are better

Critical issue:
- When novel conditions emerge, will the current syntax be sufficient to process information at the boundary?

### Semantic: Processing information => learning about sources of differences

- Even if a common syntax is present, interpretations are often different
- Differences in interpretation make communication and collaboration difficult
- Differences not always adequately represented as "differences in degree" but "differences in kind"

- Individuals use different meanings in their functional setting

- Paying attention to challenges of "conveyed meaning" => attention to tacit nature of knowledge
- Mutual understanding through communities of interaction
- Explicating new sources of difference

- Semantic approach embraces sources of difference
- Recognizes dependency
- Does not acknowledge the consequences generated by dependence

(What is dependence in this context?)

### Pragmatic

- Understanding the consequences that exist between things that are different and dependent on each other
- How is knowledge geared to make a particular effect?
- Individuals committed to and invested in their knowledge as a hard-won outcome
- Knowledge accumulated and used is often "at stake"
- Changing knowledge and skills is costly, changing hard-won outcomes comes reluctantly

Cross-boundary challenge:
- Not only is communication hard
- To resolve negative consequences, individuals have to be willing to alter their own knowledge *and* be capable of influencing or transforming the knowledge of others

Pragmatic approach to boundaries assumes presence of
- difference
- dependence
- novelty
=> overall process required for transforming existing knowledge to deal with negative consequences

Transforming knowledge:
- altering current knowledge
- creating new knowledge
- validating the new knowledge within each function and collectively across functions

## Pragmatic view of knowledge

Community of practice:
- situated and "purposive" nature of knowledge
- is created by a community of individuals
- shared practice or problem, shared consequences

Situated and tacit characteristics of knowledge
- Not enough to have a shared syntax
- Knowing cannot be separated from an individual's engagement in "practicing"

Knowledge is localized
- Knowledge localized around particular problems
- Effective development of knowledge requires specialization in different problems

Knowledge is embedded in practice
- Knowledge is hard to articulate or recall
- Also embedded in tech, methods, rules of thumb used
- We know more than we can tell
- Embeddedness in contrast to tacit knowledge being hard to retrieve from the mind

Knowledge is invested in practice:
- Methods, ways of doing, successes that demonstrate value
- When knowledge proves successful, individuals are inclined to use it in the future
- Individuals become less able and willing to change their knowledge to accommodate the knowledge developed by others they are dependent on
- Changing knowledge => facing costs of altering ways of work
- At stake: deliverables, deadlines
- Current knowledge accumulated to to achieve these things are at stake in problem-solving efforts at a boundary

(By which mechanisms is the cost of changing knowledge realized? How do ways of work become altered?)

Within a practice, these characteristics have positive benefits:
- Individuals must be able to localize knowledge
- Trial and error, learning embedded within practice
- Individuals must be invested to meet challenging requirements

Same characteristics knowledge become problematic when working across practices

## Empirical lens

Objects: collection of artifacts an individual works, creates, measures or manipulates

Ends: outcomes that demonstrate success in creating, measuring, manipulating

Work: moving an object from current state to required end state

Anthropological approach:
- Focus on how individuals apply their knowledge to the objects and ends
- Collecting data about knowledge proven difficult
- Surveys and interviews not direct enough

Questions:
- How does practice shape knowledge and the problematic boundaries that exist between different functions in product development?
- What activities or processes were effective in facilitating collaboration across knowledge boundaries?

## Within-boundary vignette

- All required functions cannot fully localize, embed and invest their knowledge within practice at the same time
=> Not all sources of difference and dependence are known up front
- Consequences will continue to emerge as the process evolves
- As individuals solve and create new solutions, novelty is created, new dependencies and often negative consequences are generated
=> Consequences have to be worked over time across practices

## Across-boundary vignette

- Updated drawing provided a shareable object and the creation of shareable ends at the boundary: across-practice boundary objects
- Before the objects used actually reinforced the boundary: functionated as within-practice objects

Repositories: common reference points, shared definitions
Standardized forms and methods: more shareable differences and consequences
Objects or models: observable representations of differences/dependencies identified at the boundary
Maps of boundaries: dependencies and boundaries that exist between groups or functions

Effective boundary objects:
- Syntactical: Establish a shared syntax or language for individuals to represent their knowledge
- Semantic: Provides a concrete means for individuals to specify and learn about their differences and dependencies across a given boundary
- Pragmatic: Facilitates a process where individuals can jointly transform their knowledge

Objects, models and maps:
- only category of boundary object that directly support transforming knowledge
- helpful in dealing with pragmatic boundaries
- most complicated and expensive to establish
- have a portfolio effect: can be used to enhance repositories et al

BOUNDARY OBJECTS ARE NOT A MAGIC BULLET
- Characteristics hard to sustain as problems and people change

## Role of boundary objects

Help establish "boundary infrastructure" or "boundary process"
- Practical: must establish shared syntax
- Political: must facilitate process of transforming current knowledge so that new knowledge can be created to resolve negative consequences

## Conclusion

- Communication across functional boundaries is hard given the problematic nature of knowledge in practice
- At a pragmatic knowledge boundary we see processes for transforming knowledge

Syntactical approach:
- based on existence of shared and sufficient syntax at boundary
- efficient because differences and dependencies have been specified and agreed to in advance

Semantic approach:
- Differences exist or emerge over time: individuals have different interpretations of a word or an event
- There are always differences in kind
- Emergence of novelty is natural when innovation is desired
- Integrating devices should be seen as processes or methods for translating and learning about differences at a boundary
- Insufficient when negative consequences are identified

Pragmatic approach:
- Recognizes differences in knowledge are not always adequately specified as differences in degree or interpretation (which could be resolved with the semantic approach)
- Given the differences and dependencies at a boundary, negative consequences can arise
- To resolve these consequences, new knowledge has to be created, old knowledge has to be changed
