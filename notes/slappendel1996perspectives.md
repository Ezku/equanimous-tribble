# \cite{slappendel1996perspectives} Perspectives on Innovation in Organisations

Innovation:
- frequently used to describe an object
- can take on other forms
- idea, practice or material artifact (Rogers and Shoemaker 1971)
- administrative and technical innovations (Kimberly and Evanisko 1981)
- work organisation, product and process innovations (Whipp and Clark 1986)

Novelty is a key feature
... but it's arguably only the _perception_ of newness that counts

Innovation:
- "any idea, practice, material artefact perceived to be new by the relevant unit of adoption" (Zaltman et al 1973)
- also the *process* through which new ideas are generated

Different levels of analysis:
- adoption by individuals
- innovation in and by organisations (described here)
- patterns in industries and national systems

Three perspectives:
- *(individualist) humanistic approach*: innovation behavior explained in terms of the personality characteristics of organisational participants
- *(deterministic) structural approach*: explanation in terms of structural differences
- *interactive process perspective*: relationship between organisation and innovation is interactively influenced by both structure and membership

### Interactive process

Basic assumption:
- Innovation produced by the interaction of structural influences and the actions of individuals

Conceptualization of an innovation:
- innovations are subject to reinvention and reconfiguration
- innovations are perceived

Conceptualization of the innovation process:
- complex process

Core concepts:
- shocks
- proliferation
- innovative capability
- context

Reesarch methodology:
- case studies
- case histories
