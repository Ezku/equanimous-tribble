# raelin2007toward Toward an epistemology of practice

Building an epistemology of practice: *mediated action* and *tentativeness*

Mediated action
: learning is facilitated through the use of tools and artifacts
: need for a space for dialogue outside normal operating procedures and structures

"Scholar-practitioners"
: intimately connected to both theory and practice worlds
: capable of importing tools from both worlds to inform the other

Tentativeness
: In spite of rational processes, there are contradictions and ambivalences that often lie at the heart of organizational life
: The map is not the territory

"Knowing may arise from the social interactions occurring as people engage in their practice"

*"Academic epistemology, interpreted as knowing in advance of practice, can lead to 'haste in wanting to know'"*
