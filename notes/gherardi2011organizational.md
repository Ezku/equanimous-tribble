## The polysemy of practice

1. Practice as a learning method
2. Practice as an occupation or field of activity
3. Practice as the way something is done

The concept of practice in academy:

1. Intentional and goal-seeking actions that also have a habitual character and follow certain general principles or procedure
2. The kind of practical and 'hidden' knowledge that supports them

Two fundamentally different conceptions of practices!

1. Practices identified with regularities or commonalities in the performances or presuppositions of some community of human agents: *practices are 'arrays of activities' that constitute models, or bundles of activities*
2. Practices characterized in terms of normative accountability of various performances: practices are *ways of doing things together*

Uses of the term practice:

Oppositional
: Theory vs practice
: Concrete action in contrast with abstract theory
Analogical
: Phenomenon studied 'as practice'
: Science as practice - interested in working practices whose subject matter was knowledge
: Strategy as practice - the study of strategy as a process of strategizing
Topological
: Practice is the place where knowledge and learning come about
: Practice as the *site of knowing and organizing*
: Practices as empirical objects and building blocks of an organization
Transformative
: Knowledge transforms itself through use
: Practice is an epistemology of the relationship between knowing and acting
**: How does knowledge circulate? How is it transformed by being transferred? How is it produced in practices?**
: Implies equivalence between knowing and practicing

## The epistemology of practice

Theories of practice
: Assume an ecological model in which agency is distributed between humans and non-humans
: The relationality between the social world and materiality can be subjected to inquiry
: View actions as 'taking place' through a network of connections-in-action

*"The epistemology of practice makes it possible to articulate the dynamic that occurs between the becoming of a practice as a socially sustained mode of action in a given context and the ‘given’ sociomaterial context in which it develops. Practice is situated between the given and the emergent as an element in the social order."*

## The becoming of a practice and its stabilization

"We may imagine what can constitute a handhold for the development of practical knowledge by assembling an ideal toolbox that enables description of a practice while it is being practiced."

### Professional vision

Three activities shape a domain of occupational knowledge (Goodwin, 1994):
- coding, which transforms phenomena observed in a specific setting into the objects of knowledge that animate the discourse of an occupation;
- highlighting, which gives salience to specific phenomena in a complex perceptual field by marking them in some manner; and
- producing and articulating material representations, which embed and structure the knowledge produced and transfer it through space and time.

When material representations are codified and articulated, some ways of doing are inscribed in tools and artefacts.

When phenomena are highlighted, not only are they marked to distinguish them, but they are also marked to an ethical and aesthetical code of practice.

Aesthetic knowledge is always involved whenever flesh-and-blood humans act
-> The study of practices gives visibility to that form of practical knowledge which is anchored in the body
-> Practice is difficult to express verbally

### Discursive practices

- The learning of sensory knowledge develops through stages within a professional community
- Participation in the community is contextual to the learning of an expert language with which to express aesthetic judgments

Discursive practices
: support formation of aesthetic judgments
: support the negotiation of aesthetic judgments within a particular occupational community


- A certain mode of practicing is sustained by aesthetic criteria intrinsic to the activity itself and formulated during its performance
- Situated discursive practices are intrinsically reflexive, ie. provide their own accountability

*"It is dissonance and not the canon which produces new music"*
: Sharing (understanding, signification, values) is tended to be overestimated in collective action
: Non-sharing (minimal or partial sharing) is a circumstance for the action of looking for signification
: Non-sharing drives constant change in practice, which comes about through negotiation on meanings and aesthetic criteria of the practice

### The equipped environment

"The more completely prepared the environment is, the easier it becomes to accomplish one's task"

"The recursiveness of practices establishes a relationship of co-production with the environment"
- not only are the handholds for action discovered in the course of the action
- delegated to these handholds is the execution of certain operations of the same practice
- helping not to forget is anchored in the materiality of signaling artifacts and technologies

*"Embedded in the theme of the equipped environment that anchors activities by suggesting to practitioners 'what next' in performance of the practice, is a metaphor which conveys the sense of how humans and artifacts intertwine for the fluid performance of a practice"*
- Improvised coreography

### Recursiveness as stabilization and legitimation

*Stabilization of a practice is founded as much upon social elements as material ones*

Stabilization in materiality
- takes place through anchorings in discursive and technological practices, in the artifacts of the practice
- are not unconnected from the cultural process that a practice institutionalizes by attributing values to the modes of doing, stabilizes them as a normative system
- further stabilization happens by being embedded in a texture of practice that the action connects and recalls

## The theoretical contribution made by the study of practices

"The emergence of practice as a unit of analysis would be one of the most promising developments within organizational learning"

The components of a practice theory of organizations?

Practice: a collective knowledgeable doing which is socially sustained

Practice is distinguished from *action* by its recurrent nature

*Recursiveness* of practices enables the reproduction of the organization in its everyday routine

For a practice to be a practice it must be seen as such by its practitioners, must be socially sustained
: sustaining practice requires the concurrence of action so that it is recurrent
: it is recurrent because it is institutionalized (sustained by values, beliefs, norms, habits, discourses)

*"Just as an orchestra never repeats is performance of a symphony in exactly the same way, so organizational practices are recurrent but never identical"*
- The dynamic of change in practice does not consist solely in the use of the resources 'at hand' to deal with variability
- Involves the social process whereby practitioners are attached to their practices
- Practices are meaningful to practitioners, they can be objects of love or hate

## The substantive contribution made by the study of practices

*"The interest in working practices arises from the fact that they are opaque"*
- Practices are opaque to their practitioners
- Knowing workin practices is necessary to design technology to support them
- **The main beneficiaries from the description and discussion of working practices are the practitioners themselves**

Opportunities given to groups of practitioners to discuss their practices
- foster reflexive learning
- lay the bases for bringing tools of daily work and the tools of analysis and design closer together

Self-confrontations and crossed-self confrontations:
- subjects are confronted with their activity and then become involved in professional controversies
- A cycle builds up around what the workers do, what they say about what they do, and what they do about what they say

Important in this methodology: how practitioners are 'struck by' certain fleeting moments within the ongoing conduct of the practice
- these moments manifest something special in their shared lives
- suggest connections and relations previously unnoticed

*"The representation of practice, by the researcher or with the researcher, is a stimulus for explicitation of that knowledge entangled in doing which may enable better verbal expression of what is known and is enacted in doing, and of which the individual may have scant awareness"*

## Conclusions

*"The highly symbolic transition from the term 'knowledge' to that of 'knowing' has opened the way for a view of knowledge as first a process and subsequently as a practical activity"*

- Practice is a polysemous term
- PBS as an umbrella-term

Two apparent orientations:
1. Practices as the object of empirical analysis (the site of learning and knowing)
2. Practice as epistemology
