## Intro

- Lean is among the fastest growing approaches used by the software development professionals
- Key trait is to eliminate waste from development
- One of the lean tools is kanban for managing production operations (Liker.J, “The Toyota Way”, McGraw-Hill, USA, 2004.)
- Kanban approach is the most recent addition to the agile and Lean software development research area.
- A strong practitioner-driven movement supporting the idea of using Kanban in software engineering has emerged (Hiranabe, K, “Kanban applied to software development: From agile to lean” 2008, Retrieved on 4 May 2012, via: http://www.infoq.com/articles/hiranabe-lean-agile-Kanban -- Shalloway, A., Beaver, G., and Trott, J. R, “Lean-agile software development: Achieving enterprise agility”, Pearson Education, Inc. / Addison-Wesley, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. 2009.)

## Kanban software engineering

- Lean and Kanban approaches were introduced in the Japanese manufacturing industry in the 1950s.
- The Kanban method in software development was originated in 2004, when David J. Anderson [9] was assisting a small IT team at Microsoft that was operating poorly. (David. J, Anderson, “Kanban: Successful Evolutionary Change for Your Technology Business”. Sequim, WA: Blue Hole Press, 2010.)

Anderson:
- It helps to visualise process problems, decrease defects and maintain a steady flow.
- By limiting work in progress a sustainable pace of development is achieved, yielding higher quality products and greater team performance.
- The combination of improved flow and higher quality software helps to shorten lead time, leading to regular releases that help in building trust among the customers.

“Scrumban” written by Corey Ladas: It suggests that eligibility to use the Kanban approach in software development depends on the satisfaction of the following two axioms.
- It is possible to divide work into small value-adding increments that can be independently scheduled.
- It is possible to develop value-adding increments in a continuous flow, from requirement to deployment.

## Results

- Papers on kanban with lean software development started in 2008 and have been on the rise since (at least until 2011), pointing to a trend

- Reported benefits corroborate Anderson's claims

Top 5 Kanban benefits, in order from most to least cited:

1. Better understanding of whole process
2. Improved software quality
3. Improved meeting of customer needs and customer satisfaction
4. Increased motivation of engineers
5. Improved communication/coordination between stakeholders/ in team

Top 5 Kanban challenges:

1. Kanban can't work alone but requires supporting practices
- support from eg agile
- mixing with agile practices may lead to eg difficulties in managing work in progress or prioritization of tasks
2. Hard to change organisational culture and philosophy
3. Lack of specialized skills and training
4. Collaboration and communication issues
5. Motivating staff to use new practices


- Implement gradually
- Patience is essential
- Kanban should used as a 'plug-in' with existing methods

Good practices in summary:
- Protect teams from external tasks during the actions phase
- Consider ways of limiting work in progress
- Create a culture of collaboration on solving tasks and problems
- Use a visual board to make low team orientation visible and improve the shared mental model
- Encourage team members to provide feedback to each other
- In order to create value, note that all non-value added work is not waste, and that some non-value added waste is necessary
- Have senior managers constantly work on value creation for the organisation, allotting time to teach and solve technical problems with teams; provide technical leadership
- Provide a clear vision for the whole team
