## Sharing meaning across occupational communities: The transformation of understanding on a production floor

Knowledge: shared in organizations through transformation of communities' situated understandings of their work

Misunderstandings on production floor:
- Linked to individuals' work contexts
- Overcome by cocreating a common ground transforming understanding of product and process

Knowledge-sharing difficulties rooted in:
- Differences in language
- Locus of practice
- Conceptualization of product

When communication problems arise, provide solutions which:
- Invoke differences in work contexts
- Create common ground between the communities
