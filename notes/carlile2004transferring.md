## Transferring, translating, and transforming: An integrative framework for managing knowledge across boundaries

Managing knowledge across boundaries in settings where innovation is desired

Innovation:

Three progressively complex boundaries:
- Syntactic, semantic, pragmatic

Three progressively complex processes:
- Transfer, translation, transformation

Framework for:
- What practical and political mismatches occur when innovation is desired?
- How does this relate to the common knowledge that actors use to share and assess each other's domain-specific knowledge?
