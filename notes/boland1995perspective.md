# \cite{boland1995perspective} Perspective Making and Perspective Taking in Communities of Knowing

"Organizations are developing innovative products and services on faster cycle time"

## Perspective making

: the process whereby a commu- nity of knowing develops and strengthens its own knowledge domain and practices
:  It is a process of developing finer language games, and from a paradig- matic standpoint, more precise causal laws
: more coherent meaning structures are developed than preceding ones

The Importance of Narrative in Perspective Making
: The typical form of framing experience (and our memory of it) is in narra- tive form. What does not get structured narratively is lost in memory
: when we nar- rativize experience, we also construct and validate the self
:  The self is always at stake in the individual's narrativizing of experience, because the self is at least the narrator and often part of the story

## The Process of Perspective Taking

*"competitive advantage and product success are a result of collaboration in which diverse individuals are able to appreciate and synergistically utilize their distinctive knowledge through a process of perspective taking"*

Much of social behavior is predicated upon assump- tions an actor makes about the knowledge, beliefs and motives of others

Valuing diversity of knowledge by enabling each type of expertise to make unique representations of their understandings, and assisting actors with dif- ferent expertise to better recognize and accept the different ways of knowing of others, is the foundation for perspective taking

characteristic of failed teams involved people's under- standing of the development process itself:
- People not only ignored the activities of others and failed to argue over relative priorities, they glossed over the concerns of others, and tended not to appreciate their complexi- ties

the problem of integration of knowledge in knowledge-intensive firms
- is not a prob- lem of simply combining, sharing or making data com- monly available.
- It is a problem of "perspective taking"
- in which the unique thought worlds of different communi ties of knowing are made visible and accessible to others

## Reflexivity, Boundary Objects and Perspective Taking

*"Once a visible representa- tion of an individual's knowledge is made available for analysis and communication, it becomes a boundary object and provides a basis for perspective taking."*

- Boundary objects can, of course, be a center of intense conflict as easily as one of coopera- tive effort.
- Creating and reshaping boundary objects is an exercise of power that can be collaborative or unilateral

Paradoxically, it is a kind of communication with others that grows out of an improved communication with self.

Communication with one's self is the basic stance of reflexivity; an inner conversation that builds and reflects upon a represen- tation of one's understanding of a situation. Being able to do so implies that the perspective making in a community of knowing has progressed far enough to provide a sufficiently strong perspective to reflect upon.
