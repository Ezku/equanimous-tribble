# \citep{engestrom2000activity} Activity theory as a framework for analyzing and redesigning work

Cultural-historical activity theory attempts to overcome dichotomies between:
- micro vs macro
- mental vs material
- quantitative vs qualitative
- observation vs intervention

## Actions, scripts and activity systems

Activity theory distinguishes between:
- short-lived, goal-directed action
- durable, object-oriented activity

Prime unit of analysis:
- collective activity system
- evolving historically
- seen in its network relations to other activity systems

Goal-directed actions and automatic operations:
- relatively independent
- understandable only against the background of activity systems
- realise and reproduce activity systems

Object of work:
- gives rise to continuity and coherence to both actions and scripts
- without the object of work the activity would cease

## Disturbances and contradictions

Disturbance = deviation from standard script (Engeström 1996, Norros 1996)
- indicate significant systemic contradictions
- change potentials within the activity

Object and motive
- give actions coherence and continuity ...
- but keep the activity system in constant instability by their internal contradictions

## Innovations and visions

Radical expansion of the object of activity:
- temporal expansion: from singular episodes to long-term trajectory
- socio-spatial expansion: from relationships between patient and practitioner to joint monitoring

The new model is
- "a spearhead of the zone of proximal development of the activity systems involved"

## Cycles of expansive learning

What specific processes or actions make up the learning?
- Eg. Nonaka & Takeuchi assume knowledge creation is something that's been assigned
- Crucial triggering action in the expansive learning process is the *questioning of the existing standard practice*

Actions of questioning and analysis
- aimed at finding and defining problems and contradictions behind them
- if assigned by management, typically rejected (Engeström 1999)

Expansive cycle of learning actions:
1. Questioning
2a. Historical analysis
2b. Actual-empirical analysis
3. Modelling the new solution
4. Examining the new model
5. Implementing the new model
6. Reflecting on the process
7. Consolidating the new practice

## The horizontal dimension

Concept formation (Vygotsky 1987) as a creative meeting:
- everyday concepts growing upward
- scientific concepts growing downward

Two-dimensional view of concept formation and learning
- Sideways move: not a merging of incompatible worlds
- alternative conceptualizations of "declared" and "experienced" concepts

## Knotworking as an historical challenge

Knotworking:
- knot as a rapid, distributed, partially improvised collaborative performance between loosely connected actors and activity systems
- knotworking as the tying, untying, retying of separate threads of activity
- non-centralized, locus of initiative changes
- longitudinal process with no clear deadline or fixed endpoint

Co-configuration (Victor and Boynton 1998)
- customer intelligence: continuously configuring products and services in interaction with the customer

"Stable standard procedures of cooperative continuous improvement are not sufficient in conditions of knotworking"
