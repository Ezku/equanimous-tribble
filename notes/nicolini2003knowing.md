Knowing in Organizations: A Practice-Based Approach

## Intro

- Organizational knowledge and learning cannot be conceived as mental processes residing in members' heads
- Knowing precedes knowledge; latter is an institutionalized version of the former
- Knowledge is acquired through participation, is continually reproduced and negotiated

Four intellectual traditions addressing phenomena of knowing and organizing from a practice-based perspective:
- interpretive-cultural approach
- "community of practice" approach
- cultural and historical activity theory approach
- sociology of translation approach (aka "_actor network theory_")

Past approaches:
- Codification of experience in some form of cognitive structure or behavioral pattern; learning as the process through which such structures and patterns change
- Knowledge as an immaterial and atemporal substance; can be taken out of context, recorded, classified, distributed
- Knowledge as an invisible assect, a form of capital that can be quantified, estimated, accumulated, exchanged as commodity

Criticism on past approaches:
- Knowledge as object instead of process is needlessly restrictive
- Debate ignores social and processual aspects of knowing and learning

"New vocabularies populate the world differently: they not only change existing ideas; they introduce new and alternative truth-values"

Contributors to the polysemy of the notion of practice:
- Marxist epistemology: "We know only that which becomes the subject of our practice"
- Phenomenology:
  - _Dasein_, subject and object indistinguishable, both exist within a social and historical setting (Heidegger)
  - Prereflexivity, "We know more than we can tell" (Polanyi)
  - Becoming knowledgeable in any field requires participation in the interaction and engagement with the local web of meaning-making processes; becoming member of the group that collectively sustains these interpretive processes
- Linguistic games:
  - participation in practice entails taking part in a professional language game, mastering the rules and being able to use them
  - intersubjective consensus is more a matter of shared environment and language than of abstract opinions

## Four practice-based ways to talk about knowing and learning

### Understanding knowing as culture and aesthetic understanding

- The practice of flute-making is at the same time the medium through which mastery is expressed and communicated, and the outcome of that mastery
- Aesthetic knowledge is the form of competence that persons acquire by activating specific capacities of their perceptive-sensorial faculties and aesthetic judgment
- Knowing is a form of aesthetic experience at once personal and social
- Practical knowledge cannot be spoken because it is not verbal in itself

### Understanding knowing as community and habitus

"Community of practice"
- Basic building blocks of social learning systems
- Function as the social containers of the competencies that make up such systems

Knowing in practice
- Knowing is a matter of displaying the socially defined competence sustained by the community
- Knowing not as a way of understanding the world but as a way of being in the world

Learning necessarily requires involvement
- there is a route that new members must follow in order to gain the esteem of the community's established members

Habitus
- knowing in practice is an embodied practical sensitivity learned and remembered; dispositions that present us with a world in which it makes sense to do some things and not others
- one cannot enter the "magic circle" by instantaneous decision of the will, but only by a slow learning and initiation process
- not based on rules, but responding to a feel - what is appropriate within the existing conditions?

### Understanding knowing as a feature of cultural and historical activity systems

Cultural and historical activity theory
- Practice-as-activity approach analyses complex activity systems
- Both the understanding of the nature of the object of work as well as the activities that go along with it are in constant *expansion*
- **Activity system** is required to learn new ways of accommodating all different composing elements

"Examine practices of strategic renewal and technological innovation in a high-tech firm"
- Knowing an an aspect of collaborative endeavors that are social and transformational in character
- Emphasizes opportunities for innovation and development of collective competencies

Cycle of mutual interaction
- An endless process that creates new practices as well as new ways to address them

Expertise: collective, heterogenous, evolving phenomena
Organisations: distributed, decentered, emergent yststems of practical knowledge
- Centrality of mediating artifacts
- Objects as organizing centers for regimes of practical expertise

The modification or emergence of new objects of work
- has the effect of bringing out the contradictions inherent in any activity system
- Requires development of new rules, mediating artifacts, ways of working that will eventually modify the object of work


### Understanding knowing as heterogenous engineering and "action net"

Sociology of translation, aka actor-network theory
- "The social" is a pattern of network of heterogenous materials kept together by active processes of ordering
- Knowing a practice is to skillfully participate in and influence the ordering of the world while pursuing one's own interests
  => Knowing is a way to describe the capacity to proceed unhampered

"Heterogenous engineering"
- Successful alignment of human and nonhuman elements

How is knowledge constituted?
- Knowing does not reside in any of the nodes of a seamless web of networked actors; it is emergent
- Knowing is the result of a system of ongoing practices and political processes
- The subject of knowing is the "action net" of these processes

"Describing practices is necessary a form of colonization through description"
- Science only knows dead objects


## Elements of a practice-based vocabulary of knowing and learning in organizations

### Some characteristics of a practice-based vocabulary for knowing in organizations

- Doing, rather than being, is at the center of attention
- Practice-oriented approaches focus on _what people actually do_

Object of inquiry:
- Capacity of humans to perform actions competently
- The temporal organization of such actions
- The resources that make them possible


Predominance of socially related terms
- Knowing is a social ecology in social patterns

Presence of terms referring to material artifacts and specific historical conditions
- Artifacts do not play a background role, but participate actively:
  - carry history
  - embody social relationships
  - distribute power
  - provide points of resistance
- What is doable and sayable?
- What is possible?
- Who can or cannot do or say?

Spatio-temporal localized nature
- Knowledge, its subjects and objects must be understood within a situated practice
- Signalling of locality in time and space of ordering efforts

Uncertainty, conflict, incoherence
- Disturbances are fundamental innovation opportunities for the activity system
- Disorder, not order, generates meaning
- "Perhaps there is ordering (knowing, acting) but there is certainly no order (knowledge, unequivocal action)"
  - Orders and ordering efforts are never complete
  - Ordering and knowing efforts permanently interfere with and resist each other

Change
- Variation stemming from unexpected events in the reproduction process?
- Constitutive of practice itself!

"A practice-based vocabulary opens up a space of discursivity that enables us to think and talk about knowing, learning and organizing in novel, broader and thicker terms"


## Why bring practice into the center of debate?

- Society increasingly relies on expert knowledge
- The disappointing results of most knowledge management tools and technologies expose the shortcomings of the traditional assumptions

Knowing and knowledge are first and foremost effects of social practices.
- Knowing and doing are difficult to conceive of as separate

From a practice perspective, the world appears to be relationally constituted
- Activities and knowing are always situated: have a specific "when" and "where"
- Stability is not a static attribute but an outcome of work

Practices
- Do not respect boundaries
- Connect things that are distant and only partially congruent
- Allow the coexistence of old and new
- Are able to deal with change and disorder while explaining persistence and order
