# \citep{ketokivi2010two} strategies for inductive reasoning

Idealization
Contextualization

- all claims based on empirical data are based on some kind of inductive reasoning
- the justification of inductive arguments is an unresolved issue

## Inductive reasoning and the practical reasoning dilemma

Practical reasoning:
- social process by which social texts proceed from grounds to claims in an attempt to convince an audience

Dilemma:
- there are no universally accepted and sound principles to govern the reasoning process

### What is the dilemma

Deduction:
- Proceeding from a set of general premises to a more specific conclusion
- normative rule is logical coherence

Inductive reasoning:
- from particulars to generalizations
- Inductive conclusions contain knowledge claims not analytically implied by the premises

### Practical reasoning, inference, and explanation

#### Toulmin's model of reasoning

Grounds: premises of argument; data, observations, theory

Claims: theoretical interpretations, empirical and theoretical generalizations

Warrants: justification for bridging grounds to claims

#### There is an distinction between inferehce and explanation

- warrants are the essence of inference: inference is the mechanism that bridges the grounds with the claims
- in order to convince an audience, both inference and explanation associated with arguments has to be defended
- inference from empirical data to theoretical explanation is _always_ based on inductive reasoning


## Idealization and contextualization as practical reasoning strategies

- Neither of these can be shown to be superior to the other

### Idealization

Form of inference: induction, deduction
Inference and explanation: separate activities
Epistemic virtue: adequacy
Seeking warrants: compliance with methodology
Rhethorical strengths: generalizable results, explicit rules
Challenges: local rules of reasoning may appear concealed

### Contextualization

Form of inference: inference to the best explanation == *abduction*

Inference and explanation: intertwined, assessed simultaneously

Epistemic virtue: *simplicity, plausibility, interestingness, novelty*

Seeking warrants: making contextualized inference transparent, demonstrating empirical authenticity

Rhetorical strengths in argumentation: transparency
- openly partial to the explanation
- authentic to data, research process

Challenges in appealing for warrants:
- applicability of findings
- unpredictability
