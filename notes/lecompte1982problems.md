# \citep{lecompte1982problems} Problems of reliability and validity in ethnographic

- analyzes problems of reliability and validity in ethnographic design
- threats to credibility of ethnographic research are summarized and categorized
- strategies intended to enhance credibility are incorporated throughout the process
- common approach to resolving categories of contamination are illustrated

## Intro

- part of the value of scientific research is in ability to demonstrate credibility of findings
- qualitative investigation has been easy to criticise for lack of reliability and validity
- results of ethnographic research often regarded as unreliable or lacking in validity and generalizability

ethnographic research =
- qualitative, case study, field, anthropological, ethnography

characteristics of ethnographic research:
- participant and nonparticipant observation
- focus on natural settings
- use of participant constructs to structure the research
- investigator avoidance of purposive manipulation of study variables

even when ethnographic techniques are adapted within a positivistic design, credibility mandates that reliability and validity be addressed

reliability in ethnographic research
- dependent on resolution of external and internal design problems
- external reliability: would independent researchers discover the same phenomena
- internal reliability: degree to which other researchers would match data with previously generated constructs in the same way

establishing validity
- determining the extent to which conclusions represent reality
- whether constructs devised by researchers represent categories of human experience that occur
- internal validity is the extent to which observations are authentic representations
- external validity is the degree to which representations may be compared legitimately across groups

## Differences between experimentation and ethnography

### Formulation of problems

Experimentation:
- credibility of research design and power of treatment are established by eliminating extraneous factors
Ethnography:
- rarely focuses on treatment
- naturalistic setting facilitates on-the-spot analysis of causes and processes
- precludes precise control of so-called extraneous factors

### Nature of goals

Ethnographers
- describe systematically the characteristics of phenomena
- generate and refine conceptual categories
- discover associations between phenomena
- compare constructs generated from phenomena in one setting with another setting

Experimental research
- tests causal propositions developed externally to the research site
- test the strength or power of causes on effects

"ethnographers hope to find a theory that explains their data"

### Application of results

- ethnographers rarely have access to conditions for generalization
- the aim in application is for comparability and translatability of findings

Comparability:
- requires that the ethnographer delineate the characteristics of the group studied or constructs generated so that they can serve as a basis for comparison with other groups

Translatability:
- assumes that research methods, analytic categories, and characteristics of phenomena and groups are identified so explicitly that comparisons can be conducted confidently


## Reliability

- The extent to which studies can be replicated
- Poses a herculean problem for researchers concerned with naturalistic behavior or unique phenomena

### Constrainct on ethnography reliability

- Research occurs in natural settings
- Often undertaken to record processes of change
- Unique situations cannot be reconstructed precisely

### External reliability

External reliability may be enhanced by handling five problems:
- researcher status position
- informant choices
- social situations and conditions
- analytic constructs and premises
- methods of data collection and analysis

Researcher status position:
- ethnographic conclusions are qualified by the investigator's social role within the research site
- reports must clearly identify the researcher's role and status within the group

Informant choices
- different informants represent different groups of constituents
- participants who gravitate towards researchers may be atypical of the group under investigation
- threats to reliability by informant bias are handled by careful description of those who provided the data

Social situations and conditions:
- what is appropriate to reveal in some contexts may be inappropriate under other conditions
- what people say and do varies according to others present at the time
- delineation of physical, social and interpersonal contexts enhance replicability of ethnographic studies
- descriptions of contexts should include function and structure as well as specification of features

Analytic constructs and premises:
- replication may remain impossible if the units of analysis which informed the original research are idiosyncratic or poorly delineated
- outlining theoretical premises that inform and shape the research facilitates replication
- units of analysis should be identified clearly

Methods of data collection and analysis
- Ideally, presents methods as an operating manual by which to replicate
- Identify and describe strategies used to collect data

### Internal reliability

Low-inference descriptors:
- As concrete and precises as possible
- Verbatim accounts
- Narratives of behavior and activity

Multiple researchers:
- Optimally, have multiple researchers

Participant researchers:
- Have informants confirm what the observer has seen and recorded

Peer examination:
- Corroboration of findings by researchers operating in similar settings

Mechanically recorded data:
- Use of observational techniques that record as much as possible

## Validity

Two questions:
- do researchers observe what they think they are observing?
- to what extent are postulates applicable across groups?

### Internal validity

History and maturation
- Establish which baseline data remain stable over time
- Which data change

Observer effects
- Possible and probable effects of the observer's presence on the nature of the data gathered must be considered

Selection and regression
- ethnographic subjects are chosen for relevance to specific interests
- use of theoretical sampling as a purpose strategy

Mortality
- how groups change over time as a result of losses and gains in membership
- collect baseline data to enable analysis of effects of subsequent loss and replacement

Spurious conclusions
- relationships posited among observed phenomena may be spurious
- eliminate rival explanations


### External validity

Selection effects:
- Some constructs cannot be compared across groups because they are specific to a single group
- Determine the degree of match between categories and reality of group under investigation

Setting effects:
- Simply studying a group may affect it in some ways
- A construct may be treated as equivalent only for groups being observed in a comparable manner

History effects:
- Cross-group comparison of constructs may be invalid due to unique historical experiences of groups and cultures

Construct effects:
- Construct validity is the extent to which abstract terms, meanings, are shared across settings, populations
- definitions of constructs can vary
- disparities in the constructs as they are used must be reported as attributes of the groups being examined
