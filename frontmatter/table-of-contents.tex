\cleardoublepage
% This command adds a PDF bookmark that links to the contents.
% You can use\addcontentsline{} as well, but that also adds contents
% entry to the table of contents, which is kind of redundant.
% The text ``Contents'' is shown in the PDF bookmark.
\pdfbookmark[0]{Contents}{bookmark.0.contents}
