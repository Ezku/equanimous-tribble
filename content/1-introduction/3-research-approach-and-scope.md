# Research approach and scope

- Qualitative study
- Case study
- Ethnographical approach
  - verifiability, credibility, comparability, translatability \citep{lecompte1982problems}
- Audio analysis methodology
- Theoretical sampling
- Abductive reasoning

The researcher is interested in gaining a deep understanding of the practice of a daily as it occurs in the context of software development. The agile discourse has a history with ethnographically-inspired studies of agile practices \citep{robinson2007ethnographically,marchenko2008scrum}, and a similar empirical approach was chosen here. An ethnographical approach is specifically well suited for discovery of how practitioners behave within and use the practice under investigation. Given the choice of theoretical background where a sociological understanding of practice plays a significant role, and the desire to observe in context, not to interfere with and to improve, ethnography makes for a sound choice. In the sense that the research also considers parts of speech and specific manipulations of the material context as a subject of investigation, the empirical study also carries microethnographical tones \citep{streeck2005microethnography}.


## \cite{robinson2007ethnographically}

- Qualitative studies of software practice appear to be unusual in empirical software engineering research
- Studies of practitioners in the setting of practice
- Understanding practice in its own terms

Ethnography
- seeks to understand practice in its own terms, minimizing the impact of the researcher
- researchers attend to the taken-for-granted, accepted and unremarkable aspects of practice, deliberately considering all activities as *strange*
- no feature of practice is discounted a priori
- the totality of practice is studied, with all its messy characteristics

Ethnographically-informedness:
- Actuality of practice needs to be ascertained empirically by appropriate studies
- Research is not driven by hypotheses, but by research questions
- real world, natural setting => aspiration not to disturb practice
- data collected through combination of methods (observation, interviews, discussion, study of artefacts), but no attempt to change practice during course of study
- avoid control, intrusion, experiment => all data is naturally occurring

Usefulness of approach:
- Cannot address questions based on hypotheses derived from theories
- 'How' and 'why' and 'what are the characteristics of'
- Capture rich interdependencies

Challenges
- Ethical issues concerning contracts & consent have been problematic
- If the researcher is part of the community of practice, how do would they be able to consider anything 'strange'? Both challenges and advantages.
- Tension involved in
    - moving between two worlds: understanding, yet considering strange
    - Need to be non-judgmental
- Benefits
    + acceptance by 'tribe'
    + not getting overwhelmed when following activity

"Practice should be disturbed as little as possible"
- No formal agreement documents
- "asking individuals for written consent would alter the relationship signiW- cantly making natural observation impossible"

Nature of findings:
- Problems and solutions
    - "There is no expectation that our answers provide direct solutions to speciWc problems."
    - "In some cases, we have uncovered problems, but investi- gation of the solutions lies outside our immediate study."
- Challenging received views
    + Knowing the actuality of software development practice, rather than the received view, is an essential prerequisite to the design of a tool, technique, or methodology to support that practice
    - "Challenging received views can inform and improve practice."
- Providing rich accounts of practice
    – "Such accounts thus provide practitioners with a mirror of their practice which might support their activities as ‘reXec- tive practitioners’"



## \cite{lethbridge2005studying}
- Software engineering involves real people in real envi- ronmentsƒ Accordingly, to truly understand software engineering, it is imperative to study people – software practitioners as they solve real software engineering problems in real environments

Data collection techniques suitable for field studies of software engineering.

### First Degree Techniques: Direct Involvement of Software Engineers

Observational first-degree techniques provide a real-time portrayal of the studied phenomena. However, it is more difficult to analyze the data, both because it is dense and because it requires considerable knowledge to interpret correctly. Observational techniques can be used at randomly chosen times or when a software engineer is engaged in a specific type of activity (such as whenever she is using a debugger). Observational techniques always run the risk of changing the process simply by observing it; the Hawthorne effect was first identified when a group of researchers found that output was not related to environmental conditions as expected, but rather to whether or not workers were being observed (Draper, 2004; Robbins, 1994). Careful consideration of this effect is therefore warranted in implementing the research and explaining its purpose and protocol to the research participants.

3.1.9. Participant Observation (Joining the Team)

"In the Participant-Observer method, the researcher essentially becomes part of the team and participates in key activities. Participating in the software development process provides the researcher with a high level of familiarity with the team members and the tasks they perform. As a result, software engineers are comfortable with the researcher_s presence and tend not to notice being observed."
- Advantages. Respondents are more likely to be comfortable with a team member and to act naturally during observation. Researchers also develop a deeper understanding of software engineering tasks after performing them in the context of a software engi- neering group.
- Disadvantages. Joining a team is very time consuming. It takes a significant amount of time to establish true team membership. Also, a researcher who becomes too involved may lose perspective on the phenomenon being observed.

### 3.2. Second Degree Techniques: Indirect Involvement of Software Engineers

Second degree techniques require the researcher to have access to the software engineer_s environment. However, the techniques do not require direct contact between the participant and researcher. First the data collection is initiated, then the software engineers go about their normal work, and finally the researchers return to collect the data that has been automatically gathered. As a result, these techniques require very little or no time from the software engineers and are appropriate for longitudinal studies.



### 3.3. Third Degree Techniques: Analysis of Work Artifacts

Third degree techniques attempt to uncover information about how software engineers work by looking at their output and by-products. Examples of their output are source code, documentation, and reports. By-products are created in the process of doing work, for example work requests, change logs and output from configuration management and build tools.

Advantage. Third degree techniques require almost no time commitment from software engineers.
Disadvantages. The data collected is somewhat removed from the actual development process; older data may relate to systems or processes that have since been significantly changed, and recent data only captures a very narrow view of software development. Also, it may be difficult to interpret the data meaningfullyVdocumentation can be hard to understand, and logs tend to contain cryptic abbreviations and comments that were only expected to form a consistent picture in the minds of the software engineers who originally wrote and read them. Due to the above, third degree techniques must normally be supplemented by other techniques to achieve research goals.

#### 3.3.1. Analysis of Electronic Databases of Work Performed

In most large software engineering organizations, the work performed by developers is carefully managed using problem reporting, change request and configuration manage- ment systems. The copious records normally left by such systems are a rich source of information for software engineering researchers.

Advantages. A large amount of data is often readily available. The data is stable and is not influenced by the presence of researchers.
Disadvantages. There may be little control over the quantity and quality of information manually entered about the work performed. For example, we found that descriptive fields are often not filled in, or are filled in different ways by different developers. It is also difficult to gather additional information about a record, especially if it is very old or the software engineer who worked on it is no longer available.

### 4.1. Record-Keeping Options

First degree contact generally involves one of the following three data capture methods: videotape, audiotape, or manual record keeping.
- Videotape captures the most complete record, while manual record keeping captures the least complete record.
- Videotaping invokes the greatest amount of interference, while manual recording keep- ing invokes the least amount of interference.
- Again, videotape is the most time-intensive data to use and interpret, while manual record keeping is the least time- intensive data to use and interpret.

Audiotape allows for a fairly complete record in the case of interviews, however details of the physical environment and interaction with it will be lost. Audiotape does allow, however, for the capture of tone. If a participant is excited while talking about a new tool, this will be captured on the audio record.


### 4.2 Coding and Analyzing the Data

Field study techniques produce enormous amounts of data
- To meet this goal, the body of data must be reduced to a comprehensible format. Traditionally, this is done through a process of coding
- That is, using the goals of the research as a guide, a scheme is developed to categorize the data. These schemes can be quite high level.


## \citep{lecompte1982problems}

characteristics of ethnographic research:
- participant and nonparticipant observation
- focus on natural settings
- use of participant constructs to structure the research
- investigator avoidance of purposive manipulation of study variables

"ethnographers hope to find a theory that explains their data"

reliability in ethnographic research
- dependent on resolution of external and internal design problems
- external reliability: would independent researchers discover the same phenomena
- internal reliability: degree to which other researchers would match data with previously generated constructs in the same way

establishing validity
- determining the extent to which conclusions represent reality
- whether constructs devised by researchers represent categories of human experience that occur


## \citep{coyne1997sampling}

selective sampling is a practical necessity

Theoretical sampling is the process of data collection whereby the researcher simultaneously collects, codes and analyses the data in order to decide what data to collect next.

Deciding where to sample next according to the emerging codes and categories is theoretical sampling.

## \citep{ketokivi2010two}

Form of inference: inference to the best explanation == *abduction*

Epistemic virtue: *simplicity, plausibility, interestingness, novelty*


## \citep{dubois2002systematic}

abductive reasoning, in which
- theoretical framework and empirical analysis inform one another over the course of the research, and
- the theoretical framework is chosen based on its ability to explain the empirical data

systematic combining
- textbooks on methodology oftentimes fail to account for benefits of nonlinearity
- by constantly going 'back and forth' from research activity to another, the researcher expands his understanding of both empirical and theoretical phenomena
- preliminary analytical framework consists of 'preconceptions'


## jonassen2012theoretical

- The activity must be studied in real-life practice with researchers as active participants \citep{kuutti1991activity}
- Necessitates a qualitative approach to analysis

Important for analysing learning situations:
- Time frame should be long enough to understand the objects of activity, changes in those objects over time and their relations to objects in other settings
- Analysts should pay attention first to broad patterns of activity before considering narrow episodic fragments that do not reveal the overall direction and importance of the activity
- Analysts should use varied data collection methods and points of view
