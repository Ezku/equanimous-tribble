## Problem statement

Based on section \ref{motivation}, the context of the problem is as follows. Agile finds that innovation happens in face-to-face interactions, with dailies being a specific example. Lean claims continuous improvement of a production system is supported with the use of lean-derived methods, such as kanban. The practice based approach sees an equivalence between practicing, knowing and learning.

If dailies support such system-level innovation as is meant by continuous improvement, this quality should be observable in daily activity. What kind of learning can we observe in the daily, and what enables it? A way to describe the mechanism of continuous improvement through the practice based perspective is needed. The research problem for this thesis is:

> **RP:** How can continuous improvement of a kanban system in the practice of a daily be explained with the practice based perspective?

## Theoretical research questions

The research problem leads us to a threefold investigation in order to understand the fundamentals in play.

> **TRQ1:** How does a daily in agile software development support the development team?

> **TRQ2:** How does the use of a kanban system support continuous improvement in the context of lean software development?

> **TRQ3:** How can continuous improvement be observed in practice?

Taking the case study in hand we are likely to face a daily quite unlike what is described in the literature. Question *TRQ1* aims at setting a point of comparison which we can take to reflect on the qualities of the daily that we will be observing. With *TRQ2* we probe the role of kanban systems within the context of lean and relate it to the lean principle of continuous improvement. We find a language for describing the social process we're observing in *TRQ3* by looking beyond software development methodology literature and delving into the practice based approach.
