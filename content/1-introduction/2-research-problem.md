In the previous section, it was stated that the daily as a practice is crucial in operating a software development team the goal of which is to continuously adapt to an unfolding reality. Given this background, the researcher is interested in characterising the practice further and teasing out its relation to grander theories of how organisations change and adapt. In a sentence, the research problem being undertaken is:

> **RP:** How can the combination of daily and kanban practices support software development?

The empirical basis for the research is formed by an ethnograpically inspired case study conducted in a software development team applying a practice that can be described as a daily in conjunction with a workflow that applies the lean idea of visualizing flow of work items to a significant degree. A practice research approach is taken to describe and dissect the practice as it occurs. Parts of systems thinking are leveraged to describe the system of work reflected within the ongoings of the daily, and this insight is used to discuss the nature of knowledge co-creation in the practice.
