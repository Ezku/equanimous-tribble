## Problem statement

<!--

In the previous section, it was stated that the daily as a practice is crucial in operating a software development team the goal of which is to continuously adapt to an unfolding reality. Given this background, the researcher is interested in characterising the practice further and teasing out its relation to grander theories of how organisations change and adapt. In a sentence, the research problem being undertaken is:

-->

> **RP:** How can the practice of a daily support continuous improvement?

<!--
The empirical basis for the research is formed by an ethnograpically inspired case study conducted in a software development team applying a practice that can be described as a daily in conjunction with a workflow that applies the lean idea of visualizing flow of work items to a significant degree. A practice research approach is taken to describe and dissect the practice as it occurs. Parts of systems thinking are leveraged to describe the system of work reflected within the ongoings of the daily, and this insight is used to discuss the nature of knowledge co-creation in the practice.

## Theoretical research questions

Our search for theoretical understanding required for answering the research question takes a three-pronged approach.

> **TRQ1:** What is a daily in agile software development?

> **TRQ2:** What is a kanban system in lean software development?

> **TRQ3:** How can the uses of daily and kanban be seen as practices in software development?

To successfully make claims about dailies and kanban, an understanding on both is required. Questions *TRQ1* and *TRQ2* are aimed at setting solid ground based on which we can find the activities observed in the empirical study as being representative of the *use of a daily* or the *use of a kanban system* respectively. Following up on that, with *TRQ3* we set out to find a way to describe dailies and kanban through a theoretical lens that can serve as a synthesis and provide vocabulary for describing both and either of them. Through this unified lens we will gain the ability to inspect them and their relation as being overlapping or simultaneous in nature, as will be required in the empirical analysis section.

I'm sure we need to consider kanban or lean in here, but probably not in the way it's been put now. We need to frame the practice as happening within the context of "software development" somehow, and at the absence of empirical material to define that for us we probably need to reach for a definition of "things constituting software development" in a broad sense. Maybe?

I can't exactly see if we really need a definition for daily: will not such a definition will be provided in the empirical study, without the need to refer to what the books say? Then again, we might benefit from being able to contrast the implementation with the theory.
