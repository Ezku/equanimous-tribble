> *What is the practice of software development dailies like and how does it relate to knowledge co-creation?"*

Agile processes and practitioners' understanding thereof evolve with use. I am interested in discovering whether the "heart" of agile, namely the daily meetup, has a relation to enabling this evolution. Can the daily itself be seen as a tool for gaining knowledge not only on proceedings, but the processes and practices applied?
