## Problem statement

In section \ref{motivation} we laid out an argument on how the using dailies can be taken to be in conflict with the lean principle of waste reduction, if we see the use of tools such as kanban alleviating the original need to have a daily in the first place <!-- FIXME: Mitä? Käytä tässä samaa problematisointia kuin aiemmin, mutta nyt ratkaisumuodossa. -->. We may however consider other uses for a daily which would mesh with lean principles. As outlined in section \ref{why-daily}, the daily might be an opportunity for learning and thus improving on the work; to continuously adapt to an unfolding reality. This matches the lean idea of continuous improvement introduced in section \ref{capacity-for-reaction}. Let us pose the following research problem statement:

> **RP:** How can the practice of a daily in conjunction with a kanban system support continuous improvement?

<!-- FIXME: Tän vois muotoilla uudestaan nyt kun sulla on havainto millaisia tulosksia sulla on jotta olisi kirkkaampi. -->

## Theoretical research questions

The research problem leads us to a threefold investigation in order to understand the fundamentals in play.

> **TRQ1:** How does a daily in agile software development support the development team?

> **TRQ2:** How does the use of a kanban system support continuous improvement in the context of lean software development?

> **TRQ3:** How can continuous improvement be observed in practice?

Taking the case study in hand we are likely to face a daily quite unlike what is described in the literature. Question *TRQ1* aims at setting a point of comparison which we can take to reflect on the qualities of the daily that we will be observing. With *TRQ2* we probe the role of kanban systems within the context of lean and relate it to the lean principle of continuous improvement. We find a language for describing the social process we're observing in *TRQ3* by looking beyond software development methodology literature and delving into the practice based approach.
