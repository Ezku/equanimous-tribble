> *How do dailies enable process evolution in a software development team?*

Agile processes and practitioners' understanding thereof evolve with use. I am interested in discovering whether the "heart" of agile, namely the daily meetup, has a relation to enabling this evolution. Can the daily itself be seen as a tool for gaining knowledge not only on proceedings, but the processes and practices applied?
