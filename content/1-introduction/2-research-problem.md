## Problem statement

In section \ref{motivation} we laid out an argument on how the practice of a daily can be taken to be in conflict with the lean principle of waste reduction, if we see the use of tools such as kanban alleviating the original need to have a daily in the first place. We may however consider other uses for a daily which would mesh with lean principles. As outlined in section \ref{why-daily}, the daily might be an opportunity for learning and thus improving on the work; to continuously adapt to an unfolding reality. In lean terms, this is dubbed continuous improvement. Let us pose the following research problem statement:

> **RP:** How can the practice of a daily support continuous improvement?

## Theoretical research questions

The research problem leads us to a threefold investigation in order to understand the fundamentals in play.

> **TRQ1:** How does a daily in agile software development support the development team?

> **TRQ2:** How does the use of a kanban system support continuous improvement in the context of lean software development?

> **TRQ3:** How can activity theory be used to observe continuous improvement in practice?

Taking the case study in hand we are likely to face a daily quite unlike what is described in the literature. Question *TRQ1* aims at setting a point of comparison which we can take to reflect on the qualities of the daily that we will be observing. With *TRQ2* we probe the role of kanban systems within the context of lean and relate it to the lean principle of continuous improvement. Detaching ourselves from the bounds of the agile and lean discourses we find a language for describing the social process we're observing by discovering an activity theoretical perspective in *TRQ3*.
