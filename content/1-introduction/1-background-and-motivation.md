# Background and motivation

Within agile literature, necessity of face-to-face interaction is emphasized as critical for transfer of ideas and achieving innovative results. \citep{highsmith2002agile}

In the agile manifesto, this characteristic was considered important enough for it to take first place on a list of agile values: "individuals and interactions over processes and tools". \citep{agile2001manifesto}

The importance of this characteristic is further highlighted by how "daily scrum", a meeting of developers deriving its name from the Scrum methodology \citep{schwaber1995scrum}, has become a symbol of sorts for agility itself. Yet \cite{marchenko2008scrum} cite problems like "too many meetings" and disciplined effort required to keep things simple as present challenges.

- When is there too much face-to-face time?
- How do processes stay simple?
- Do dailies help in making tacit

\cite{abrahamsson2002agile} further characterizes simplicity and ease of adaptation as key to agile process models. For instance, time constraints of a daily may be relaxed or the general agenda modified if it is found that they do not aid in reaching desired goals \citep{marchenko2008scrum}.

- What is needed for this process to happen?
- How does it happen in practice?
- Are dailies itself a component of this process change or?

"Evolution": incremental improvement through an iterative process of "seeing what sticks"
