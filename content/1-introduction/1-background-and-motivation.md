## Rise of agile and lean software development

Agile software development practices have become mainstream \citep{west2010agile}. The Scrum methodology \citep{schwaber1995scrum} belongs among the most popular \citep{west2010agile}, being heralded as virtually a de-facto industry standard \citep{marchenko2008scrum}. Another wave of organisations are taking up a lean software development approach, which espouses some of the same practices but presents a different underlying set of principles.

What is it with agile and lean that companies in the IT industry might find attractive? Original motivations for the "new-school" methodologies might have included a desire to figure out simply ways to build better software. Agile can in some respects be taken as antithetical to so-called *waterfall* methodologies which were seen to be a flawed approach. Software development is not like building a house, so attempting to understand and deconstruct the process in a similar fashion lead to less than stellar results. Neither is software development like running a factory, yet a brief look into the history of lean will reveal its roots to be in a factory industry. To see where lean fits in the software development scene, it could be though of as a principled way to figure out better ways to do things.

Agile process models have been further characterized with simplicity and ease of adaptation as key \citep{abrahamsson2002agile}. Agile is represented as the antithesis of dogma, being fit for critical inspection and malleable to use-case specific needs. But if there's no definite way, how do you know you're doing the right things? Adopting agile is indeed not easy when your starting point is a mindset borrowed from the times of the industrial revolution. Agile's very nature seems to have changed with introduction to the mainstream \citep{west2010agile}, with \citet{marchenko2008scrum} citing problems like "too many meetings" and disciplined effort required to "keep it simple" as present challenges.

Perhaps these two pieces can be taken together to form a discourse. Agile originally offered the promise of ways to build better software, but was easily oversold as a silver bullet, leading to failures in adoption and disillusionment. Clearly there was something positive there, but how could *our* organisation make use of it? The path to agile adoption was anything from clear. Enter lean software development: with the endorsement of ideas like "start where you are" and "continuous improvement", one could conceptually figure out the *path* to enlightenment instead of the ostensible *destination*.

A question that both agile and lean attempt to answer in their own ways is "how does one operate in a changing environment". Agile takes a somewhat constrained view by recognizing that when delivering software to a customer, their needs can and will be changed. This can be by virtue of a changing business environment, better understood requirements for the system under development or any number of surprises often so characteristic of projects in real life. The reality of the situation is then accommodated for by building software such that it is amenable to changes in plans with the least amount of effort. Lean's perspective is grander in that it admits for *ways of doing* needing to change as understanding grows and situations change.

## The relation to the practice of *dailies*

Necessity of face-to-face interaction is emphasized in agile literature as critical for transfer of ideas and achieving innovative results. \citep{highsmith2002agile} In the agile manifesto, this was considered important enough for it to take first place on a list of agile values: "individuals and interactions over processes and tools". \citep{agile2001manifesto}

To be clear, there is no one single way to run a team or company "the agile way". There is, however, consensus on some things. One thing that is undeniably part of the agility toolkit is the practice of a daily: a meeting between development team members taking place every day. "The daily scrum", as described in the leading individual methodology \citep{west2010agile}, could even be construed to have become a symbol of sorts for agility itself. There is a by-the-book description of what a daily is in the literature, yet owing to the malleability of agile, how the practice is implemented will likely vary significantly. For instance, time constraints of a daily may be relaxed or the general agenda modified if it is found that they do not aid in reaching desired goals \citep{marchenko2008scrum}.



Also a key set piece for scrum is the scrum board, or a glorified to-do list.
