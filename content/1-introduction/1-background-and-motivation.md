The daily has become part of IT industry vernacular. The word refers to a meeting of software development team members taking place every day \citep{sutherland2014scrum}. Stemming from the popular Scrum methodology of agile software development, dailies are a very commonplace occurrence in the field \citep{west2010agile}. Agile encompasses methodologies which reflect the quality of "agility" to varying degrees \citep{abrahamsson2002agile} as well as a manifesto which encapsulates some of its early evangelists' most important values \citep{agile2001manifesto}. Methodologies under the agile umbrella have been characterized with simplicity and ease of adaptation as key \citep{abrahamsson2002agile}. When agile methods such as the daily are applied, they don't always work as introduced \citep{marchenko2008scrum}. The situation is problematic for practitioners, because successfully modifying methods that have originally been developed by trial-and-error is difficult \citep[p. xiii-xvi]{poppendieck2003lean}.

A new school of lean software development aspires to supplant Scrum and its ilk as the *de facto* approach to software processes \citep{ahmad2013kanban}. Lean's purported advantage is that it provides principles based on which concrete methods may be developed \citep{poppendieck2003lean}. The perspective lean offers on software development is that it can be seen as a value-producing system. This systems thinking is evident in lean-derived methods such as kanban, with its focus on visualizing and managing flow of work \citep{ahmad2013kanban}. Lean aims at process improvement through reduction of waste, or non-value-adding activities \citep{poppendieck2003lean}. More broadly, lean-derived methods can be described as striving towards continuous improvement \citep{bhuiyan2005overview}.

The Scrum methodology is focused on project management \citep{marchenko2008scrum}, and agile implementations have been criticized as using practitioners' time ineffectively \citep{begel2007usage}. The introduction of lean sets the agile daily under fire, and its use must be motivated not only through its role in agile methodology but by its usefulness. In agile literature, the daily is posited as an opportunity for face-to-face interaction, the necessity of which is held to be critical for transfer of ideas and achieving innovative results \citep{highsmith2002agile}.

Lean's goal of continuous improvement and agile's claim of innovation in face-to-face interaction have parallels which intersect in practice. It cannot be that the mere existence of a kanban modelling, for instance, allows continuous improvement to take place. Instead, it must be that the improvement happens somehow in conjunction with the use of such a method by practitioners. Likewise, investigating the assertion that dailies enable innovation in social interaction requires that we look into what happens in practice. The tools of neither agile nor lean are apt at describing such mechanisms, so we must reach for understanding elsewhere.

The *practice-based approach* of organizational research looks at knowledge as acquired, used and observed in participation, or knowing as something that is inseparable from doing \citep{nicolini2003knowing}. Practicing can be viewed as a transformative process: not only is there an equivalence between knowing and practicing, but knowledge transforms itself through use \citep{gherardi2011organizational}. Innovation in social interactions has been studied in practice-based activity theory \citep{hakkarainen2004communities}.
