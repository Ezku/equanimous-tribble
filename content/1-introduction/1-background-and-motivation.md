# Background and motivation

Agile software development practices have become mainstream \citep{west2010agile}. The Scrum methodology \citep{schwaber1995scrum} belongs among the most popular \citep{west2010agile}, being heralded as virtually a de-facto industry standard \citep{marchenko2008scrum}.

Necessity of face-to-face interaction is emphasized in agile literature as critical for transfer of ideas and achieving innovative results. \citep{highsmith2002agile} In the agile manifesto, this was considered important enough for it to take first place on a list of agile values: "individuals and interactions over processes and tools". \citep{agile2001manifesto}

The "daily scrum", a meeting of developers deriving its name from the Scrum methodology, as the most prominent component of the leading individual methodology \citep{west2010agile}, can be claimed to have become a symbol of sorts for agility itself.

Agile process models have been further characterized with simplicity and ease of adaptation as key \citep{abrahamsson2002agile}. For instance, time constraints of a daily may be relaxed or the general agenda modified if it is found that they do not aid in reaching desired goals \citep{marchenko2008scrum}. Agile is represented as the antithesis of dogma, being fit for critical inspection and malleable to use-case specific needs. Yet its nature seems to have changed with introduction to the mainstream \citep{west2010agile}, with \citet{marchenko2008scrum} citing problems like "too many meetings" and disciplined effort required to "keep it simple" as present challenges.

- "Evolution": incremental improvement through an iterative process of "seeing what sticks"
