# Background and motivation

Agile has become mainstream. \cite{west2010agile}

Necessity of face-to-face interaction is emphasized in agile literature as critical for transfer of ideas and achieving innovative results. \citep{highsmith2002agile} In the agile manifesto, this was considered important enough for it to take first place on a list of agile values: "individuals and interactions over processes and tools". \citep{agile2001manifesto}

The importance of this characteristic is further highlighted by how "daily scrum", a meeting of developers deriving its name from the Scrum methodology \citep{schwaber1995scrum}, has become a symbol of sorts for agility itself with Scrum being heralded as virtually a de-facto industry standard. \cite{marchenko2008scrum} Yet \cite{marchenko2008scrum} cite problems like "too many meetings" and disciplined effort required to keep things simple as present challenges.

- When is there too much face-to-face time?
- How do processes stay simple?
- Do dailies help in making tacit

Agile process models have been further characterized with simplicity and ease of adaptation as key. \cite{abrahamsson2002agile} For instance, time constraints of a daily may be relaxed or the general agenda modified if it is found that they do not aid in reaching desired goals \citep{marchenko2008scrum}.

- What is needed for this process to happen?
- How does it happen in practice?
- Are dailies itself a component of this process change or?

"Evolution": incremental improvement through an iterative process of "seeing what sticks"
