## Rise of agile and lean software development {#rise-of-agile-and-lean}

Agile software development practices have become mainstream \citep{west2010agile}. Among the family of agile methodologies, Scrum introduced by \cite{schwaber1995scrum} belongs among the most popular \citep{west2010agile}, being heralded as virtually a de-facto industry standard \citep{marchenko2008scrum}. This research will refer to Scrum as the prototypical example of what it could mean to be agile.

What is it with agile that companies in the IT industry might find attractive? Original motivations for the "new-school" methodologies might have included a desire to figure out simply ways to build better software. Agile can in some respects be taken as antithetical to so-called *waterfall* methodologies which were seen to be a flawed approach. Software development is not like building a house, so attempting to understand and deconstruct the process in a similar fashion lead to less than stellar results.

Agile process models have been further characterized with simplicity and ease of adaptation as key \citep{abrahamsson2002agile}. Agile is represented as the antithesis of dogma, being fit for critical inspection and malleable to use-case specific needs. But if there's no definite way, how do you know you're doing the right things? Adopting agile is indeed not easy when your starting point is a mindset borrowed from the times of the industrial revolution. Agile's very nature seems to have changed with introduction to the mainstream \citep{west2010agile}, with \citet{marchenko2008scrum} citing problems like "too many meetings" and disciplined effort required to "keep it simple" as present challenges.

To be clear, there is no one single way to run a team or company "the agile way". There is, however, consensus on some things. Necessity of face-to-face interaction is emphasized in agile literature as critical for transfer of ideas and achieving innovative results. \citep{highsmith2002agile} In the agile manifesto, this was considered important enough for it to take first place on a list of agile values: "individuals and interactions over processes and tools". \citep{agile2001manifesto} One thing that is undeniably part of the agility toolkit is the practice of a daily: a meeting between development team members taking place every day. "The daily scrum", as described in the leading individual methodology \citep{west2010agile}, could even be construed to have become a symbol of sorts for agility itself. There is a by-the-book description of what a daily is in the literature, yet owing to the malleability of agile, how the practice is implemented will likely vary significantly. For instance, time constraints of a daily may be relaxed or the general agenda modified if it is found that they do not aid in reaching desired goals \citep{marchenko2008scrum}.

Another wave of organisations are taking up a lean software development approach, which espouses some of the same practices but presents a different underlying set of principles. Like building a house, neither is software development like running a factory, yet a brief look into the history of lean will reveal its roots to be in a factory industry. To see where lean fits in the software development scene, it could be though of as a principled way to figure out better ways to do things.

## Capacity for reaction as the differentiator {#capacity-for-reaction}

One could consider an important difference between agile and lean practice to be the degree of responsivity to new input. As per Scrum, an agile team is run in *iterations* or *sprints* with a fixed agenda. This is based on the idea that *timeboxing* allows a team to focus on essential things needing to be done. A lean process, on the other hand, is built upon the concept of *pull-based flow*. Team members will pull work items for themselves when they are ready to do so, and it is the job of the system built around the team to make sure they have work items to pull in. Fundamentally, a timeboxed team will take into account new input before the start of a sprint, while every instance of a work item being *pulled* into the flow is an opportunity to reflect on new information. A visualization of the flow of work used in lean is called a *kanban board*, a concept related to Scrum's aptly named *Scrum board* which is used to detail a sprint's work items.

A question that both agile and lean attempt to answer in their own ways is "how does one operate in a changing environment". Agile takes a somewhat constrained view by recognizing that when delivering software to a customer, their needs can and will be changed. This can be by virtue of a changing business environment, better understood requirements for the system under development or any number of surprises often so characteristic of projects in real life. The reality of the situation is then accommodated for by building software such that it is amenable to changes in plans with the least amount of effort. Lean's perspective is grander in that it admits for *ways of doing* needing to change as understanding grows and situations change.

Perhaps these two pieces can be taken together to form a discourse. Agile originally offered the promise of ways to build better software, but was easily oversold as a silver bullet, leading to failures in adoption and disillusionment. Clearly there was something positive there, but how could *our* organisation make use of it? The path to agile adoption was anything from clear. Enter lean software development: with the endorsement of ideas like "start where you are" and "continuous improvement", one could conceptually figure out the *path* to enlightenment instead of the ostensible *destination*.

## Why would you have a daily? {#why-daily}

In section \ref{rise-of-agile-and-lean} we made the assumption of a team having a daily due to it being part of the package ascribed by the Scrum playbook. Indeed, cargo cults where the participants are not aware of why they choose their methods exist in the industry. However, taking a note from the previous section and admitting that ways of doing can be questioned, let's assume that the team is equipped with a sense of reflexivity sufficient to ask the very reasonable question: why would you have a daily?

It is easy to come up with arguments on how the daily might not be an effective use of its participants' time. They are synchronous, meaning participants must be present simultaneously. Though the recommended time box for a daily is 15 minutes, this length limit does not go without saying (as we will observe in section \ref{daily-structure}). Throughout that time, no code is written, no bugs are fixed, no features are implemented, and no customer is served. There are very real opportunity costs associated with having a daily. Making the assumption that the daily is not mandated by external factors (such as perhaps an external consultant insisting on a strict adherence to Scrum), there must be some other value that the team sees in spending that time.

What is the value seen by the team? It must be that the team itself has a hypothesis, an understanding of the value sought, or it would not choose to have dailies. For a team aware of the costs, making the contrary choice would be deliberately wasteful, so let us further assume that not to be the case. The people engage in something that has no value in terms of software development work done, but is ostensibly worthy of spending everyone's time on *every day*. Because no tangible "work" gets done, it follows that the time left for that work afterwards can hypothetically be spent more effectively. The daily's role must be in somehow enhancing the organisation's effectiveness, meaning capability for value-adding service delivery.

## Given what we know today, what do we do next? {#what-next}

Continuing from the line of thought started in \ref{capacity-for-reaction}, we will consider another argument having to do with the handling of new input. This is done in the hopes that we will be able to see the daily and the use of kanban as related through serving the same needs.

Software development is not done against a static, unchanging background. This is indeed the basis on which modern methodologies build upon and where they derive their usefulness from, as discussed in \ref{rise-of-agile-and-lean}. We can say, at the very minimum, that situations change in the world outside somehow, and that to optimize its behavior for yielding better outcomes an organization would do well to take into account these changes. But here the aspiring kanban practitioner may be faced with a dilemma. The world changes a lot; there is at any given point a potentially unbounded queue of input to process, against a very decidedly bounded capacity for handling that input. A perfect system will absorb any and all input to make perfectly informed decisions on what to act upon. Alas, the world is not perfect, and we will not be stopping every day to reconsider everything possible in the light of new input. Let us call this the bounded rationality dilemma.

As discussed in \ref{capacity-for-reaction}, a kanban system is on one respect a visualization of work and as such serves to answer the question of *how things get done*. Taking into account the bounded rationality dilemma, the system needs to be accompanied with an answer to the related but subtly different question of *what is a thing needing to get done*. Consider the crude example of a web based service's production servers being literally on fire. This is surely a situation where a team will be reaching for the fire extinguisher without the question of consulting a kanban board. Indeed, situations do arise where taking prompt action is crucial; in other situations it is not at all clear what the salient points in the input are and what there is to be done. There are literal fires, obvious to any human being, but what is to be made of figurative fires and what would give one the ability to tell them apart from entirely benign or even meaningless events?

Let us briefly go back to lean and apply the same question to kanban as we did for dailies. Why visualize work, and why use kanban especially? Of course, kanban being a thing that takes effort and time to execute yet not being software development per se, the line of argumentation we just followed could be found compelling here as well. With no further considerations needed we can conclude that they must both be supportive of software development. Given that conclusion, what is the relation between the two?

Consider a daily with an agenda defined by the Scrum sprint's goals. We would think that when the agenda is fixed and can be known to parties beforehand, the discussion and actions undertaken will be directed towards getting those things done in the fashion the team believes to be best. "I did X yesterday, I'm going to do Y today and will be needing help with Z" would be an apt description of a common schema that each team member could use their chance of communicating at the daily for. This is, indeed, part of recommended best practice. Yet with us now having a way to tell exactly what the mentioned X, Y and Z are by taking a look at the visualization of our work, is not the daily rendered redundant?

What if we consider the situation in a lean workflow when there might be any amount of new input for the team to absorb? Fresh customer insight, feature requests, bug reports and detected anomalies in running production systems are a few examples of what a team might want to decide on reacting to. The space of things to discuss and potential actions to take is vastly larger, giving rise to the possibility for a very different and arguably more interesting daily to emerge. The researcher would argue that instead of kanban making the daily redundant, the combination of both is instead worthy of investigation.

## Dailies and kanban as interrelated practice

The previous section argues that the intersection of a daily and kanban might have interesting features. To rephrase section \ref{why-daily}, the researcher finds that the only reasonable hypothesis would be that the development of the software is somehow made better through this: that there's some means, some knowledge that is gained through the engaging in a daily that at least plausibly more than makes up for the time spent.

What is missing a description of *how* the daily is of value. To avoid a circular argument or a *begging the question* fallacy, we should avoid reaching for this description in the very literature that recommends it. So, how do we describe the daily? We would like to come up with a way to describe the daily as a recurring event where knowledge is produced, made better or different in some way. In doing this we would find ourselves capable of not only showing how a real-life daily *is*, but deriving a description for the *use* of such a daily from first principles. On the corollary, failing to do so would shed some doubt on the fundamental usefulness of the activity.

Drawing from section \ref{capacity-for-reaction}, if being reactive to new input is important to software development efforts, the daily may be seen as a *sensory organ* for the software development organisation to feel its way forward in a chaotic and ever-changing landscape. Both agile and lean discourses have their own ways of discussing and arguing about these things, of course. The researcher would prefer to have at hand a more universal, a less context-dependant tool of evaluating the kind of organizational-learning-through-knowledge-work at hand here. Luckily, there exists a branch of applied sociology called *organizational research* and within that branch resides something called the *practice-based approach* \citep{nicolini2003knowing}.

The research conducted in this paper aims to describe the practice of a daily in the context of lean software development, give a rich account of it through a case study and connect the practice to larger themes of knowledge co-creation and organisational learning. We want to elucidate both how a daily happens in practice, and what the practical outcomes are, or in other words: against the background of lean principles, *what exactly is the use of a daily?*

------------

Section \ref{rise-of-agile-and-lean} mentions that a key part of the lean perspective to software development is the fact that it describes principles for improving, not ascribed ways of doing things.

In section \ref{capacity-for-reaction}, on the other hand, it was claimed that it might be prudent to inspect the role that dailies might take within a lean workflow.

If "changing the system", so to speak, is one way for an organization to become better at building software, and dailies are an event where new input to the system is considered, might this systematic, continuous improvement and dailies be related? What happens in dailies, really? How might a team know how to do things better after engaging in whatever goes on in there?

One key way for this improvement to happen is to inspect the flow of work items on a kanban board and change the system so that the flow smoothens and becomes more stable, predictable. As a visualization of the work, the kanban board is a description of the system the work occurs in, and changes to it should - in theory - reflect back to the system somehow.

Scrum literature describes per-sprint retrospectives intended for improving the process at great length; lean principles include *kaizen*, which is Japanese for continuous improvement.
