## Rise of agile and lean software development

Agile software development practices have become mainstream \citep{west2010agile}. Among the family of agile methodologies, Scrum introduced by \cite{schwaber1995scrum} belongs among the most popular \citep{west2010agile}, being heralded as virtually a de-facto industry standard \citep{marchenko2008scrum}. This research will refer to Scrum as the prototypical example of what it could mean to be agile.

What is it with agile that companies in the IT industry might find attractive? Original motivations for the "new-school" methodologies might have included a desire to figure out simply ways to build better software. Agile can in some respects be taken as antithetical to so-called *waterfall* methodologies which were seen to be a flawed approach. Software development is not like building a house, so attempting to understand and deconstruct the process in a similar fashion lead to less than stellar results.

Agile process models have been further characterized with simplicity and ease of adaptation as key \citep{abrahamsson2002agile}. Agile is represented as the antithesis of dogma, being fit for critical inspection and malleable to use-case specific needs. But if there's no definite way, how do you know you're doing the right things? Adopting agile is indeed not easy when your starting point is a mindset borrowed from the times of the industrial revolution. Agile's very nature seems to have changed with introduction to the mainstream \citep{west2010agile}, with \citet{marchenko2008scrum} citing problems like "too many meetings" and disciplined effort required to "keep it simple" as present challenges.

Another wave of organisations are taking up a lean software development approach, which espouses some of the same practices but presents a different underlying set of principles. Like building a house, neither is software development like running a factory, yet a brief look into the history of lean will reveal its roots to be in a factory industry. To see where lean fits in the software development scene, it could be though of as a principled way to figure out better ways to do things.

Perhaps these two pieces can be taken together to form a discourse. Agile originally offered the promise of ways to build better software, but was easily oversold as a silver bullet, leading to failures in adoption and disillusionment. Clearly there was something positive there, but how could *our* organisation make use of it? The path to agile adoption was anything from clear. Enter lean software development: with the endorsement of ideas like "start where you are" and "continuous improvement", one could conceptually figure out the *path* to enlightenment instead of the ostensible *destination*.

A question that both agile and lean attempt to answer in their own ways is "how does one operate in a changing environment". Agile takes a somewhat constrained view by recognizing that when delivering software to a customer, their needs can and will be changed. This can be by virtue of a changing business environment, better understood requirements for the system under development or any number of surprises often so characteristic of projects in real life. The reality of the situation is then accommodated for by building software such that it is amenable to changes in plans with the least amount of effort. Lean's perspective is grander in that it admits for *ways of doing* needing to change as understanding grows and situations change.

## Capacity for reaction and relation to the practice of *dailies*

To be clear, there is no one single way to run a team or company "the agile way". There is, however, consensus on some things. Necessity of face-to-face interaction is emphasized in agile literature as critical for transfer of ideas and achieving innovative results. \citep{highsmith2002agile} In the agile manifesto, this was considered important enough for it to take first place on a list of agile values: "individuals and interactions over processes and tools". \citep{agile2001manifesto} One thing that is undeniably part of the agility toolkit is the practice of a daily: a meeting between development team members taking place every day. "The daily scrum", as described in the leading individual methodology \citep{west2010agile}, could even be construed to have become a symbol of sorts for agility itself. There is a by-the-book description of what a daily is in the literature, yet owing to the malleability of agile, how the practice is implemented will likely vary significantly. For instance, time constraints of a daily may be relaxed or the general agenda modified if it is found that they do not aid in reaching desired goals \citep{marchenko2008scrum}.

One could consider an important difference between agile and lean practice to be the degree of responsivity to new input. As per scrum, an agile team is run in *iterations* or *sprints* with a fixed agenda. This is based on the idea that *timeboxing* allows a team to focus on essential things needing to be done. A lean process, on the other hand, is built upon the concept of *pull-based flow*. Team members will pull work items for themselves when they are ready to do so, and it is the job of the system built around the team to make sure they have work items to pull in. Fundamentally, a timeboxed team will take into account new input before the start of a sprint, while every instance of a work item being *pulled* into the flow is an opportunity to reflect on new information.

Given this difference, what happens in the practice of a daily in either of the scenarios? We would think that when the agenda is fixed and can be known to parties beforehand, the discussion and actions undertaken will be directed towards getting those things done in the fashion the team believes to be best. "I did X yesterday, I'm going to do Y today and will be needing help with Z" would be an apt description of a common schema that each team member could use their chance of communicating at the daily for. This is, indeed, part of recommended practice. What if we consider the situation in a lean workflow when there might be any amount of new input for the team to absorb? Fresh customer insight, feature requests, bug reports and detected anomalies in running production systems are a few examples of what a team might want to decide on reacting to. I would argue that this scenario is vastly more interesting to investigate. The space of things to discuss and potential actions to take is vastly larger, giving rise to the possibility for a very rich practice of a *daily* to emerge.

Against this background, I feel it is crucial to look into the practice of a daily embedded within a lean workflow. I argue that if being reactive to new input is important to software development efforts, the practice of a daily may be seen as a *sensory organ* for the software development organisation to feel its way forward in a chaotic and ever-changing landscape. Within the field of software development, it is thus one of the most important practices to focus on as a key enabler of success.

The research conducted in this paper aims to describe the *practice of a daily* in the context of *lean software development*, give a rich account of it through a case study and connect the practice to larger themes of *knowledge co-creation and organisational learning*.
