# Background and motivation

Agile software development practices have become mainstream. \citep{west2010agile} The Scrum methodology \citep{schwaber1995scrum} belongs among the most popular \citep{west2010agile}, being heralded as virtually a de-facto industry standard \citep{marchenko2008scrum}. The "daily scrum", a meeting of developers deriving its name from the Scrum methodology, has become a symbol of sorts for agility itself.

Necessity of face-to-face interaction is emphasized in agile literature as critical for transfer of ideas and achieving innovative results. \citep{highsmith2002agile} In the agile manifesto, this was considered important enough for it to take first place on a list of agile values: "individuals and interactions over processes and tools". \citep{agile2001manifesto}

Agile process models have been further characterized with simplicity and ease of adaptation as key. \cite{abrahamsson2002agile} For instance, time constraints of a daily may be relaxed or the general agenda modified if it is found that they do not aid in reaching desired goals \citep{marchenko2008scrum}. Yet \citet{marchenko2008scrum} cite problems like "too many meetings" and disciplined effort required to keep things simple as present challenges.

"Evolution": incremental improvement through an iterative process of "seeing what sticks"


- When is there too much face-to-face time?
- How do processes stay simple?
- Do dailies help in making tacit

- What is needed for this process to happen?
- How does it happen in practice?
- Are dailies itself a component of this process change or?
