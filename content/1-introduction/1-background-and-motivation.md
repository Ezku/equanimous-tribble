## Well-founded claims

Agile software development methods have become mainstream \citep{west2010agile}.

Agile encompasses methodologies which reflect the quality of "agility" to varying degrees \citep{abrahamsson2002agile} as well as a manifesto which encapsulates some of its early evangelists' most important values \citep{agile2001manifesto}.

Methodologies under the agile umbrella have been characterized with simplicity and ease of adaptation as key \citep{abrahamsson2002agile}.

There is no one single way to run a team or company "the agile way" \citep{kruchten2007voyage}.

Necessity of face-to-face interaction is emphasized in agile literature as critical for transfer of ideas and achieving innovative results. \citep{highsmith2002agile}

In the agile manifesto, this was considered important enough for it to take first place on a list of agile values: "individuals and interactions over processes and tools". \citep{agile2001manifesto}

Agile's very nature seems to have changed with introduction to the mainstream \citep{west2010agile}.

For instance, time constraints of a daily may be relaxed or the general agenda modified if it is found that they do not aid in reaching desired goals \citep{marchenko2008scrum}.

Practitioners who would like to discover their own ways of implementing agility have been disappointed by agile's lack of first principles which to use when deriving new methods. \citep[p. xiii-xvi]{poppendieck2003lean}

\citet{marchenko2008scrum} cite problems like "too many meetings" and disciplined effort required to "keep it simple" as challenges in agile implementations.

Enter lean software development: with the endorsement of ideas like "start where you are" and "continuous improvement", one could conceptually figure out the *path* to enlightenment instead of the ostensible *destination* <!-- FIXME: Love this line, but the end land a bit funny. -->.

They are synchronous, meaning participants must be present simultaneously. <!-- FIXME: What about location? --> Though the recommended time box for a daily is 15 minutes, this limit may well remain unheeded (as we will observe in the empirical study). Throughout that time, no code is written, no bugs are fixed, no features are implemented, and no customer is served. There are very real opportunity costs associated with having a daily.

<!-- FIXME: Mä en keksi mitä nää viimeiset kappaleet tuo tähän lisää. Jos sieltä pitää noukkai joku ajatus leanista niin nouki se sieltä seasta - introssa ei ole aikaa alkaa harhailla. -->

There is, however, another problem. Software development is not done against a static, unchanging background <!-- FIXME: Onko tämä kappale toistoa osiosta "capacity for reaction as the differentiator"? -->. This is indeed the basis on which modern methodologies build upon and where they derive their usefulness from, as discussed in section  \ref{rise-of-agile-and-lean}. We can say, at the very minimum, that situations change in the world outside somehow, and that to optimize its behavior for yielding better outcomes an organization would do well to take into account these changes. But the world changes a lot; there is at any given point a potentially unbounded queue of input to process, against a very decidedly bounded capacity for handling that input. A perfect system will absorb any and all input to make perfectly informed decisions on what to act upon. Alas, the world is not perfect, and we will not be stopping every day to reconsider everything possible in the light of new input. Let us call this the bounded rationality dilemma <!-- FIXME: Tätä sä et ainakaan keksinyt itse -> lähdeviite. Lisäksi kappalehan kuvaa juuri tätä -> aloita kappale tällä. -->.

a kanban system is on one respect a visualization of work and as such serves to answer the question of *how things get done*.

the system needs to be accompanied with an answer to the related but subtly different question of *what is a thing needing to get done*.

if being reactive to new input is important to software development efforts, the daily may be seen as a *sensory organ* for the software development organisation to feel its way forward in a chaotic and ever-changing landscape

<!-- FIXME: Sinänsä hyvä kohta problematisoida eli löytää se ongelma johon sä vastaat, mutta mä menisin ennemmin sitä kautta että pitäisi katsoa tarkemmin mitä oiekast ikentällöä tehdään, eteenkin tilanteissa missä ammattilaiset "mix and matchaa" aineksia laajemmista ammatillisista agile- ja lean-diskursseista. Tällainen problematisointi voisi myös johtaa sulavammin seuravan kappaleen practice-näkökulmaan: katsomme *käytäntöä* joak sijaitsee todellisessa maailmassa kaikkine sotkuineen -->

The *practice-based approach* of organizational research looks at knowledge as acquired, used and observed in participation, or knowing as something that is inseparable from doing \citep{nicolini2003knowing}.

Practicing can be viewed as a transformative process: not only is there an equivalence between knowing and practicing, but knowledge transforms itself through use \citep{gherardi2011organizational}.
