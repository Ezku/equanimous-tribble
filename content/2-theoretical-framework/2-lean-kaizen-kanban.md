# The Lean perspective

In section \ref{agile} we described how agile took off after the prominent failure of plan-driven methods to help with software development, and how Scrum and dailies relate to the picture in terms of everyday software development activities. In this section we're going to cover the field of *lean software development*, see where it diverges from agile and what kind of principles we can discover.

## Agile's lean heritage

The seminal work on lean software development is Lean Software Development by Mary and Tom Poppendieck (2003). We'll be using their description of lean to set the stage and see how the discourse is positioned in relation to agile.

In the book's foreword, Jim Highsmith and Ken Schwaber – both prominent signatories to the agile manifesto only some years earlier \citep{agile2001manifesto} – both individually rejoice at the possibility of applying lean industrial practices to software development \citep[p. xiii-xvi]{poppendieck2003lean}. Highsmith takes note that while agile had an heritage in lean industrial practices, they were simply unapplicable before this work. Schwaber explains that agile processes were constructed "based on experience, trial-and-error, knowledge of what didn't work, and best practices", and that these new tools would allow agile practitioners "to understand why and how the most common agile processes work, or to modify them based on a deep understanding of them, or to construct their own agile process".

In other words, lean was pitched as reaching further towards the fundamentals of agile ideas, and allowing the discovery of new practices which would nevertheless serve to achieve the goals set by agile. Where methodologies like Scrum had been a playbook detailing what was essentially black magic and the potential to devolve into cargo cult[^cargocult] software development, lean would serve as a process construction kit.

[^cargocult]: Cargo Cult Science being famous from Richard Feynman's commencement address at Caltech 1974. He relates a story of an indigenous people who imitate the operation of a runway in hopes of making cargo planes land, yet none do. They're missing something essential. \citep{feynman19986}
