# The lean perspective

In section \ref{agile} we described how agile took off after the prominent failure of plan-driven methods to help with software development, and how Scrum and dailies relate to the picture in terms of everyday software development activities. In this section we're going to cover the field of *lean software development*, see where it diverges from agile and what kind of principles we can discover.

## Agile's lean heritage

The seminal work on lean software development is Lean Software Development by Mary and Tom Poppendieck (2003). We'll be using their description of lean to set the stage and see how the discourse is positioned in relation to agile.

In the book's foreword, Jim Highsmith and Ken Schwaber – both prominent signatories to the agile manifesto only some years earlier \citep{agile2001manifesto} – both individually rejoice at the possibility of applying lean industrial practices to software development \citep[p. xiii-xvi]{poppendieck2003lean}. Highsmith takes note that while agile had an heritage in lean industrial practices, they were simply unapplicable before this work. Schwaber explains that agile processes were constructed "based on experience, trial-and-error, knowledge of what didn't work, and best practices", and that these new tools would allow agile practitioners "to understand why and how the most common agile processes work, or to modify them based on a deep understanding of them, or to construct their own agile process".

In other words, lean was pitched as reaching further towards the fundamentals of agile ideas, and allowing the discovery of new practices which would nevertheless serve to achieve the goals set by agile. Where methodologies like Scrum had been a playbook detailing what was essentially black magic and the potential to devolve into cargo cult[^cargocult] software development, lean would serve as a process construction kit.

[^cargocult]: Cargo Cult Science being famous from Richard Feynman's commencement address at Caltech 1974. He relates a story of an indigenous people who imitate the operation of a runway in hopes of making cargo planes land, yet none do. They're missing something essential. \citep{feynman19986}

## Lean and software development

\citet{poppendieck2003lean} observe that software development might have a lot to learn from new product development in general. They leverage principles of what is called *lean development* according to an approach used by automotive manufacturers Toyota and Honda starting from the 1980s \citep[see eg.][]{ohno1988toyota}, which they describe thusly:

> Don't make irreversible decisions in the first place; delay design decisions as long as possible, and when they are made, make them with the best available information to make them correctly.

To these and other related qualities they attribute a significant competetive advantage exhibited by the Japanese manufacturers over U.S. ones; advantage of this kind would ostensibly be desirable to any software company as well. What's good about this approach is that it doesn't come as a bundle of practices to apply, but as principles "understood and proven by managers in many disciplines outside of software development". Principles being universal guiding ideas and insights, which are however not easy to apply to particular environments.

The *seven lean principles* forming the basis of lean thinking are defined by \citet{poppendieck2003lean} as follows.

1. **Eliminate waste.** Anything in the process not contributing to value as perceived by the customer is waste.
2. **Amplify learning.** Software development is a process of learning what works, not an exercise of reducing variation; trying out different approaches and seeing what works must be enabled.
3. **Decide as late as possible.** Deferring decisions is a requirement for effective strategy in complex and evolving environments.
4. **Deliver as fast as possible.** Fast delivery is critical from both customer value and feedback cycle perspectives.
5. **Empower the team.** The people who actually do the work are the ones who understand how to achieve excellence in execution.
6. **Build integrity in.** Software must be sound conceptually, be able to maintain its usefulness over time, and altogether be fit for purpose.
7. **See the whole.** Measuring the specialized contribution of individuals or organizations leads to suboptimization, which is antithetical to integrity.
