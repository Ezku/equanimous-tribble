# Theoretical research questions

Our search for theoretical understanding required for answering the research question takes a three-pronged approach.

> **TRQ1:** What is a daily?

> **TRQ2:** What is a kanban system?

> **TRQ3:** How can the uses of daily and kanban be seen as practices?

To successfully make claims about dailies and kanban, an understanding on both is required. Questions *TRQ1* and *TRQ2* are aimed at setting solid ground based on which we can find the activities observed in the empirical study as being representative of the *use of a daily* or the *use of a kanban system* respectively. Following up on that, with *TRQ3* we set out to find a way to describe dailies and kanban through a theoretical lens that can serve as a synthesis and provide vocabulary for describing both and either of them. Through this unified lens we will gain the ability to inspect them and their relation as being overlapping or simultaneous in nature, as will be required in the empirical analysis section.
