# Improvement in practice

In what we have described so far, the theme of improvement has been most central. Practitioners of Scrum wished to discover a way of doing things better than plan-driven methods allowed for, and lean principles direct one not only towards one solution but a way of doing things such that change is not only tolerated but enabled and supported. In knowledge work organisations there is often little to force one's hand about how a process is laid out, because it exists largely in peoples' minds and not as a manufacturing pipeline. In this vein we could go deeper and attempt to find out what it is that enables a practice to support continuous improvement. How can we describe such a process of improvement and the means by which it happens? In the following we will draw from the theoretical toolbox of the practice-based approach in an attempt to find the necessary means of description.

## Improvement as a social process of innovation {#process-of-innovation}

The improvement of ways of working requires taking novel approaches distinct from how things are done in the present state. The word 'innovation', on the other hand, is often attached to concrete objects, yet it can take other forms; the key feature is simply *novelty*. \citep{slappendel1996perspectives} Innovation can be taken as "any idea, practice, material artefact perceived to be new by the relevant unit of adoption". <!-- FIXME: Sources --> (Zaltman et al 1973; also Rogers and Shoemaker 1971) Crucially, innovation may also be applied to the *process* through which new ideas are generated. \citep{slappendel1996perspectives}

- This characterisation of continuous improvement as *continuous innovation*, where the focus is on learning and knowledge management, is not a new one. \citet{boer2003continuous} observe that the field of research has been migrating towards that direction from the earlier *kaizen* or "shop floor CI" approach focused perspective.

Should we take software development to be a collaborative activity where innovations are required to deliver novel solutions, we may also consider the process of delivering or aiding the delivery thereof as something that may be innovated on. Innovation in social interactions has been studied in *innovative knowledge communities*. \citet{hakkarainen2004communities} outline three different perspectives on them:

1. **SECI model.** \citep{nonaka1995knowledge} Knowledge is something that can be explicated and objectified. Innovation happens by transforming tacit knowledge to explicit.
2. **Activity theory.** \citep{engestrom1999perspectives} Knowledge is embedded within practices. Overcoming tensions inherent in the activity is a source of innovation.
3. **Conceptual artefacts.** \citep{bereiter2002education} Knowledge is expanded by manipulation of shared conceptual artefacts. The ability to extend and create novel artefacts is the source of innovation.

Out of these perspectives we should pick one suited especially for reflecting agile and lean practices. If we consider Engestrom's perspective and knowledge as being embedded in practices, then innovation must be the development of those practices. Indeed, Engestrom is specifically looking at communities where innovation is the development of practices with a shared object of activity.

The most prominent conjunction of activity theory and software development has been in the field of human-computer interaction research, for example \citet{kuutti1996activity} and \citet{kaptelinin1996activity}. These works mainly take interest on what happens in the interface between human and computer instead of on what people do together. \citet{barthelmess2002view} and \citet{adler2005evolving}, however, take an activity theoretical view on the process of software development and show that the perspective is applicable for describing some of the industry's most problematic features. In their view, creation of software is distinct from "construction" in that it consists of conception and refinement of designed, intangible artefacts; yet the artefacts are complex and need to be specified in excruciating detail as a collaborative effort. Therefore software development deserves to be described as a knowledge based practice.

The activity theoretical approach appears to be a good fit for describing CI based on what we found out in section \ref{ci}. We will be looking at continuous improvement as taking place within the context of an interactive, social process of innovation as occurring on the level of a group of people having the same object of activity. In the empirical study will be taking this view and applying a strategy inspired by \citet{nicolini2009zooming}, where we *zoom in* to a practice and inspect it on different levels - from patterns of interactions between individuals to the wider texture of related practices. But first, let's get acquainted with activity theory and how it relates to our focus of investigation, innovation.

## Activity theoretical perspective on innovation

### Principles of activity theory

Activity theory distinguishes different activities by their objects. \citep{kerosuo2010promoting} The object of an activity is the reason the activity exists; without the object of work the activity would cease. \citep{engestrom2000activity} An activity system may be seen as a sensemaking device where the "raw" object is, as the outcome of a process, transformed into another, collectively understood object. \citep{engestrom2001expansive}

\citep{engestrom2001expansive}:

1. Prime unit of analysis: an activity system seen in its relations to other activity systems
2. Multi-voicedness
3. Historicity
4. Contradictions as sources of change
5. Possibility of expansive transformations

"Different activities are distinguished by their objects" \citep{kerosuo2010promoting} - this is a source of tension and contradictions




### Tensions, disturbances and contradictions as a source of innovation

Developmental contradictions (Engestrom 1987) Need state:

- contradictions arise between elements of the activity system
- developing contradictions first arise as errors, disturbances and indeterminate discontent

Contradiction: tension between opposing forces (Engestrom 1987)

- drives change by generating tensions, disturbances, attempts for development
- contradictions emerge as historically accumulated structural tensions

Successful social processes of innovation can be enhanced through expansive learning (Engestrom 1987)

Expansive cycle of learning actions \citep{engestrom2000activity}:

1
:   Questioning
2a
:   Historical analysis
2b
:   Actual-empirical analysis
3
:   Modelling the new solution
4
:   Examining the new model
5
:   Implementing the new model
6
:   Reflecting on the process
7
:   Consolidating the new practice

\citep{miettinen2006sources}:

- "construction of a shared object is essential to innovation and novelty"
- "the formulation of a critical problem already implies the possibility and direction of the solution"

\citep{kerosuo2010promoting}:

- "The creation of new practices, ie. the creation of social innovations, is a slow process"
- in order to understand the process of innovation, contradictions in the scrutinized activity and their transformations need to be understood
