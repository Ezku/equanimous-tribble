# Improvement in practice

## To improve is to innovate

- Define "improvement" as "innovation"



## Social process of innovation {#process-of-innovation}

Different perspectives we could take (Innovative knowledge communities \citep{hakkarainen2004communities}):

\citet{nonaka1995knowledge}, SECI model
- knowledge as something that can be explicated and objectified

\citet{engestrom1999perspectives}, activity theory:
- knowledge embedded in practices
- overcoming tensions as the source of innovation

\citet{bereiter2002education}:
- knowledge in shared conceptual artefacts
- working on and extending knowledge objects as the source of innovation

Let's pick a perspective. Because we're looking at the daily as a practice and only incidentally at the system of boards, we might well do with Engestr√∂m's framework.

## Activity theoretical perspective on innovation

### Principles of activity theory

### Expansive learning in activity theory

### Tensions, disturbances and contradictions as a source of innovation
