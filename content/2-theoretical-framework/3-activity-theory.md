# Improvement in practice

## To improve is to innovate

- The improvement of ways of working requires taking novel approaches distinct from how things are done in the present state
- This is, in short, innovation; the key feature being novelty \citep{slappendel1996perspectives}
- The word 'innovation' is often attached to concrete objects, but it can take other forms.
- Innovation can be taken as "any idea, practice, material artefact perceived to be new by the relevant unit of adoption" (Zaltman et al 1973; also Rogers and Shoemaker 1971)
- Crucially, innovation may also be applied to the *process* through which new ideas are generated. \cite{slappendel1996perspectives} Should we consider software development an activity where innovations are required to deliver novel solutions, we may also consider the process of delivering or aiding the delivery thereof as something that may be innovated on.
- We will be looking at continuous improvement as taking place within the context of an interactive, social process of innovation as occurring on the level of a team of people
- This characterisation of continuous improvement as *continuous innovation*, where the focus is on learning and knowledge management, is not a new one. \citet{boer2003continuous} observe that the field of research has been migrating towards that direction from the earlier *kaizen* or "shop floor CI" approach focused perspective.

## Social process of innovation {#process-of-innovation}

\citet{hakkarainen2004communities} outline three different perspectives on *innovative knowledge communities*:

1. \citet{nonaka1995knowledge}, SECI model. Knowledge is something that can be explicated and objectified.
2. \citet{engestrom1999perspectives}, activity theory: knowledge is embedded within practices. Overcoming tensions inherent in the activity is a source of innovation.
3. \citet{bereiter2002education}, knowledge is expanded by manipulation of shared conceptual artefacts. The ability to extend and create novel artefacts is the source of innovation.

Let's pick a perspective. Because we're looking at the daily as a practice and only incidentally at the system of boards, we might well do with Engestr√∂m's framework.

## Activity theoretical perspective on innovation

### Principles of activity theory

### Expansive learning in activity theory

### Tensions, disturbances and contradictions as a source of innovation
