## Answers to theoretical research questions

> **TRQ1:** How does a daily in agile software development support the development team?

Agile software development refers to a class of software development models, which may be seen as belonging to a particular culture or perhaps even ideological movement. Agile methodologies may be characterised by incremental software delivery, cooperativity between developers and clients, straightforwardness and adaptability, and adaptivity to changing circumstances.

The daily belongs among the most popular of agile practices. It was coined by early practitioners of the Scrum methodology, also belonging to the strongest influencers in the industry.

Dailies occur in the context of sprints, development cycles which last for a preset time on the order of weeks. A sprint has a predefined list of work items assigned to it, representing the most important requirements to be satisfied.
The daily is a short, all-hands meeting held every day. In the daily, participants discuss the progress of work items and whether help is needed to resolve impediments to progress.

An agile daily supports the development team by providing a daily ritual which empowers the team members to aid each other and helps them focus on the essential in the context of a sprint with defined goals.

## Empirical research questions {#empirical-research-questions}

The following research questions are posed to the empirical research data.

> **ERQ1**: How does the observed daily practice compare to the agile description of a daily?

> **ERQ2**: How to tensions, disturbances and contradictions arise in a daily?

The first question, *ERQ1*, considers the activity system the daily is embedded in, the "practice-nature" of the daily. We would like to observe the constituents of the activity system and describe them in relation to our theoretical preconceptions from section \ref{scrum-daily}. Furthermore, how can we see the role of virtual kanban boards used by the team in the practice?

With the second question *ERQ2* we ask whether we can observe the necessary elements for expansive learning to take place. Can we see contradictions emerging? Between which elements of the activity system, or between systems? Do contradictions get resolved? When the team engages in a daily, does it evolve?

The undertaking, is, altogether, to describe the daily as a practice within software development, serving to improve on the team's understanding and being linked to the exercise of creating software. If we further show that the daily supports a process of expansive learning, we can conclude that there is use for the daily as a mechanism for the continuous improvement of a software development team â€“ or put more simply, *improving on how the work works*.
