## Answers to theoretical research questions

> **TRQ1:** How does a daily in agile software development support the development team?

> **TRQ2:** How does the use of a kanban system support continuous improvement?

> **TRQ3:** How can we describe continuous improvement in practice in terms of activity theory?

## Empirical research questions {#empirical-research-questions}

The following research questions are posed to the empirical research data.

> **ERQ1**: How does the observed daily practice compare to the agile description of a daily?

> **ERQ2**: How to tensions, disturbances and contradictions arise in a daily?

The first question, *ERQ1*, considers the activity system the daily is embedded in, the "practice-nature" of the daily. We would like to observe the constituents of the activity system and describe them in relation to our theoretical preconceptions from section \ref{scrum-daily}. Furthermore, how can we see the role of virtual kanban boards used by the team in the practice?

With the second question *ERQ2* we ask whether we can observe the necessary elements for expansive learning to take place. Can we see contradictions emerging? Between which elements of the activity system, or between systems? Do contradictions get resolved? When the team engages in a daily, does it evolve?

The undertaking, is, altogether, to describe the daily as a practice within software development, serving to improve on the team's understanding and being linked to the exercise of creating software. If we further show that the daily supports a process of expansive learning, we can conclude that there is use for the daily as a mechanism for the continuous improvement of a software development team â€“ or put more simply, *improving on how the work works*.
