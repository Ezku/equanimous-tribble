## Answers to theoretical research questions

> **TRQ1:** How does a daily in agile software development support the development team?

Agile software development refers to a class of software development methodologies, which may be seen as belonging to a particular culture or perhaps even ideological movement. Agile may be characterised by incremental software delivery, cooperativity between developers and clients, straightforwardness and adaptability, and adaptivity to changing circumstances. The daily belongs among the most popular of agile methods in practice. It was coined by early practitioners of the Scrum methodology, also belonging to the strongest influencers in the industry.

The daily is a short, all-hands meeting held every day. Dailies occur in the context of sprints, development cycles which last for a preset time on the order of weeks. A sprint has a predefined list of work items assigned to it, representing the most important requirements to be satisfied. In the daily, participants discuss the progress of work items and whether help is needed to resolve impediments to progress. An agile daily thus supports the development team by providing a daily ritual which empowers the team members to aid each other and helps them focus on the essential in the context of a sprint with defined goals.

> **TRQ2:** How does the use of a kanban system support continuous improvement in the context of lean software development?

Lean software development is an application of lean development principles, originally used in the automotive industry, to the field of software development. The first principle, which may be taken to be the goal of lean, is the elimination of waste. Waste is everything not contributing to value seen by the customer. Software development, on the other hand, is necessarily an effort of learning or discover better ways to build things. Finally, continuous improvement is the collaborative and unending effort to eliminate waste.

In rapidly changing and complex environments, work coordination is a difficult problem. Also, to leverage input from feedback cycles for learning, delivery should be as fast as possible. For fast value delivery, it is essential that workers be able to interpret by themselves what work there is to be done. A kanban system in software development is used to visualize the workflow and manage the flow of work items through it. Such a system facilitates understanding of the process and being able to see waste in the process as it exists.

The use of a kanban system in lean software development supports continuous improvement in two ways. Firstly, it directly supports faster value delivery, which contributes to continuous improvement by enabling learning. Secondly, it supports seeing waste in the workflow, which potentially allows for addressing the generation of that waste.

> **TRQ3:** How can continuous improvement be observed in practice?

Improvement in general may be seen as a social process of innovation, which can apply to practices. Innovation in social interactions has been studied in innovative knowledge communities. Activity theory is a practice-based approach with which we can look into innovation.

Activity theory describes practices as historical, object-oriented activity systems. Collaboration in the system is artefact-mediated and bounded by rules and division of labor in a community of practice. Activity systems are in a perpetual state of contradiction, or structural tension between parts of practice. Innovation in activity systems is understood as expansive transformation of the object of activity, whereby these tensions are resolved.

Contradictions are the source of innovation. They arise in practice as errors, disturbances or discontent, which indicate that the system exhibits change potential. Primary contradictions are a questioning of a part of accepted practice, exerting pressure on the current state of practice by pointing out a failing. By offering explanations and analysis, secondary contradictions opposing the change pressure can present themselves. If a suitable transformation of the situation is found, tertiary contradictions occur when the new part of practice is fitted with its surrounding system. Finally, a model of action found viable will have to deal with other interfacing practices, and quaternary contradictions can be observed due to the realignment required. Expansive learning is thus a progression of constructing and resolving contradictions, but these do not need to occur in any specific temporal order.

Activity theory may be used to observe continuous improvement in practice by seeing the practice as an activity system, paying attention to developmental contradictions that occur in the practice, and investigating any resulting transformations in the object of activity.

## Empirical research questions {#empirical-research-questions}

The following research questions are posed to the empirical research data.

> **ERQ1**: How is the observed daily positioned with regard to descriptions of Scrum daily and kanban systems in the theory?

> **ERQ2**: How do contradictions and their transformations manifest in the observed dailies?

With ERQ1 we will establish the observed daily practice, which will allow us to position the practice in relation to the theory of Scrum dailies and kanban systems. We will elucidate the aspects by which the observed practice exemplifies what the theory says should occur, and the aspects by which the practice differs from theory. The practice will be described in terms of being an activity system, especially by the definition of its object of activity. Finally, we will be left with hints on what *is not* static in this practice and what we should thus pay attention to when looking for clues of continuous improvement.

The establishment of a normal state of affairs is also done in preparation for ERQ2. In the second part of the empirical analysis we will observe how the regular flow of the practice is *disturbed*, taken off-script. Particularly, we will be able to show that disturbances bring forth contradictions of different kinds, as implied by the theory of developmental contradictions. We will show that there exist *transformations* in the object of activity, and will be able to describe these transformations as potentially happening as the result of a number of interrelated episodes where contradictions of different kinds have been brought forth.

The undertaking is first to to describe the daily as a practice within software development, serving to improve on the team's understanding of its workflows and being linked to the exercise of creating software. We will further show that the daily is a platform that supports surfacing contradictions considering the team's workflow. Thus we will be able to conclude that there is use for the daily as a mechanism that supports continuous improvement of a software development team â€“ or put more simply, *improving on how the work works*.
