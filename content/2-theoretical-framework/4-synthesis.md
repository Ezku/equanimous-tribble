## Answers to theoretical research questions

> **TRQ1:** How does a daily in agile software development support the development team?

Agile software development refers to a class of software development methodologies, which may be seen as belonging to a particular culture or perhaps even ideological movement. Agile may be characterised by incremental software delivery, cooperativity between developers and clients, straightforwardness and adaptability, and adaptivity to changing circumstances.

The daily belongs among the most popular of agile practices. It was coined by early practitioners of the Scrum methodology, also belonging to the strongest influencers in the industry. The daily is a short, all-hands meeting held every day.

Dailies occur in the context of sprints, development cycles which last for a preset time on the order of weeks. A sprint has a predefined list of work items assigned to it, representing the most important requirements to be satisfied.
In the daily, participants discuss the progress of work items and whether help is needed to resolve impediments to progress.

An agile daily supports the development team by providing a daily ritual which empowers the team members to aid each other and helps them focus on the essential in the context of a sprint with defined goals.

> **TRQ2:** How does the use of a kanban system support continuous improvement in the context of lean software development?

Lean software development is an application of lean development principles, originally used in the automotive industry, to the practice of software development. The first principle, which may be taken to be the goal of lean, is the elimination of waste. Waste is everything not contributing to value seen by the customer. Software development, on the other hand, is necessarily an effort of learning or discover better ways to build things. Finally, continuous improvement is the collaborative and unending effort to eliminate waste.

In rapidly changing and complex environments, work coordination is a difficult problem. Also, to leverage input from feedback cycles for learning, delivery should be as fast as possible. For fast value delivery, it is essential that workers be able to interpret by themselves what work there is to be done. A kanban system in software development is used to visualize the workflow and manage the flow of work items through it. Such a system facilitates understanding of the process and being able to see waste in the process as it exists.

The use of a kanban system in lean software development supports continuous improvement in two ways. Firstly, it directly supports faster value delivery, which contributes to continuous improvement by enabling learning. Secondly, it supports seeing waste in the workflow, which potentially allows for addressing the generation of that waste.

> **TRQ3:** How can activity theory be used to observe continuous improvement in practice?

Improvement in general may be seen as a social process of innovation, which can apply to practices. Innovation in social interactions has been studied in innovative knowledge communities. Activity theory is a practice-based approach with which we can look into innovation.

Activity theory describes practices as historical, object-oriented activity systems. Collaboration in the system is artefact-mediated and bounded by rules and division of labor in a community of practice. Activity systems are in a perpetual state of contradiction, or structural tension between parts of practice. Innovation in activity systems is understood as expansive transformation of the object of activity, whereby these tensions are resolved.

Contradictions are the source of innovation. They arise in practice as errors, disturbances or discontent, which indicate that the system exhibits change potential. Primary contradictions are a questioning of a part of accepted practice, exerting pressure on the current state of practice by pointing out a failing. By offering explanations and analysis, secondary contradictions opposing the change pressure can present themselves. If a suitable transformation of the situation is found, tertiary contradictions occur when the new part of practice is fitted with its surrounding system. Finally, a model of action found viable will have to deal with other interfacing practices, and quaternary contradictions can be observed due to the realignment required. Expansive learning is thus a progression of constructing and resolving contradictions, but these do not need to occur in any specific temporal order.

Activity theory may be used to observe continuous improvement in practice by seeing the practice as an activity system, paying attention to developmental contradictions that occur in the practice, and investigating any resulting transformations in the object of activity.

## Empirical research questions {#empirical-research-questions}

The following research questions are posed to the empirical research data.

> **ERQ1**: How does the observed daily practice compare to the agile description of a daily?

> **ERQ2**: How do tensions, disturbances and contradictions arise in a daily?

The first question, *ERQ1*, considers the activity system the daily is embedded in, the "practice-nature" of the daily. We would like to observe the constituents of the activity system and describe them in relation to our theoretical preconceptions from section \ref{scrum-daily}. Furthermore, how can we see the role of virtual kanban boards used by the team in the practice?

With the second question *ERQ2* we ask whether we can observe the necessary elements for expansive learning to take place. Can we see contradictions emerging? Between which elements of the activity system, or between systems? Do contradictions get resolved? When the team engages in a daily, does it evolve?

The undertaking, is, altogether, to describe the daily as a practice within software development, serving to improve on the team's understanding and being linked to the exercise of creating software. If we further show that the daily supports a process of expansive learning, we can conclude that there is use for the daily as a mechanism for the continuous improvement of a software development team â€“ or put more simply, *improving on how the work works*.
