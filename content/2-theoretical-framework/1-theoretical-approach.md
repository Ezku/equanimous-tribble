# Theoretical approach

In my thesis I will review literature from software development process, organizational, and sociological research to create a theoretical synthesis.

Depictions of agile methodology adoption, practice and evolution:

- Rise of agile into the mainstream and the abandonment of agile orthodoxy \citep{west2010agile}
- Agile practice and culture \citep{sharp2004ethnographic,robinson2005organisational,robinson2007ethnographically}
- Challenges in agile adoption \citep{nerur2005challenges,marchenko2008scrum}

(Problem: Most "agile" literature seems to take the perspective of Scrum, XP et al, where I'd be more interested in a Kanban & Lean perspective.)

Understanding the agile organization as an evolving sociotechnical system:

- Roots of agile principles \citep{vidgen2006organizing,nerur2010towards}
- Systems of problems and interactive planning \citep{ackoff1997systems}

Characterization of scrum / kanban boards or virtual ones:

- The role of story cards \citep{sharp2006role}
- Visualizations as objects of continuously unfolding epistemology \citep{ewenstein2009knowledge}
- Boundaries as enablers of and barriers to innovation \citep{carlile2002pragmatic}

How might new information be created by manipulating aforementioned artefacts:

- New knowledge creation by intersubjectively accepted novel distinctions \citep{tsoukas2009dialogical}
