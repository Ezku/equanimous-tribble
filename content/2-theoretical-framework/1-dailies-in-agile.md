## Discovering Scrum

"Traditional" models of software developments, well-researched and mature \citep{huo2004software}, are heavy. They assume that requirements may be discovered beforehand, that they will not undergo significant change through the duration of a project and that fundamentally, the process of developing software is predictable and repeatable \citep{sutherland2001agile}. By these qualities they can be called *plan-driven* \citep{abrahamsson2002agile}. The quintessential example of a traditional methodology would be the *waterfall*: gather requirements, devise a solution, program the solution, bring it to customers \citep{sutherland2001agile,huo2004software}. Rinse and repeat.

Turns out, this analytical view of software processes has multiple points of failure. A project's premises may change on the way \citep{highsmith2002agile}, defining requirements is notoriously tricky \citep{lindstrom2004extreme}, and in fact it appears that plan-driven models on the whole don't reflect the reality of software development well at all \cite{abrahamsson2002agile}.
