## Discovering Scrum

"Traditional" models of software developments, well-researched and mature \citep{huo2004software}, are heavy. They assume that requirements may be discovered beforehand, that they will not undergo significant change through the duration of a project and that fundamentally, the process of developing software is predictable and repeatable \citep{sutherland2001agile}. By these qualities they can be called *plan-driven* \citep{abrahamsson2002agile}. The quintessential example of a traditional methodology would be the *waterfall*: gather requirements, devise a solution, program the solution, bring it to customers \citep{sutherland2001agile,huo2004software}. Rinse and repeat.

Turns out, this analytical view of software processes has multiple points of failure. To start with: a project's premises may change on the way \citep{highsmith2002agile}, defining requirements is notoriously tricky \citep{lindstrom2004extreme}, and in fact it appears that plan-driven models on the whole don't reflect the reality of software development well at all â€“ especially in the fast growth internet and mobile software industries \cite{abrahamsson2002agile}.

Enter agility. The _Manifesto for Agile Software Development_ \citep{agile2001manifesto} introduced the umbrella moniker "agile" as a word to describe a new class of models. Reality being complex and diverse, it's no surprise that the manifest itself covers five different models \citep{fowler2001agile}, and eg. \citet{abrahamsson2002agile} identify eight. Agility may well be seen as an ideological movement, or a culture of which many interpretations exist \citep{glass2001agile,kruchten2007voyage}. \citet{abrahamsson2002agile} characterise agile models with the following attributes:

Incrementality
:   Delivery of software in short cycles

Customer collaboration
:   Developers and their clients in unhindered, continuous communication

Simplicity
:   Easy to learn, well documented, readily adaptable

Plans may change
:   Options are not locked down, making alterations as needed is enabled

The term agile is thus identified as remarkably polysemous and dependant on context. To get more concrete, we will be discussing a specific agile process methodology called *Scrum*.
