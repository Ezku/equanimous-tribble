## Practical implications

### The daily reflects the activity system

In section \ref{segments-in-depth} we observed how the team carries out a daily. We had the chance to see the position the team takes on the boards and items therein. What the boards contain are tasks or work that is potentially but not necessary intended to be completed by the team in the future. Each item is therefore a description of work, but its setting in the context of the boards affords the team an understanding of *how* this work will be completed.

Equipped with this knowledge, we can make the claim that the boards are a description of the team's understanding of the *activity system* that the team is embedded within and the items are tokens for *networks of activities* that occur within the system. For instance, a developer and QA have entirely different interpretations of the actions that a specific item implies should be taken, but they are modelled by the same item moving through the system description nonetheless.

Taking this idea further, not only are the boards and their arrangement a reflection of the activity system, but *the daily itself* is such a reflection as well. This is because, as shown in section \ref{relation-between-daily-and-boards}, the structure of a daily is afforded by the structure of the boards. The arrangement of the boards gives rise to an agenda for the daily, and the agenda may correspondingly be modified by a change to the arrangement.

#### Discovering the best thing to do

*How does the daily practice reflect the activity system as understood by the team?*

A key question that the team attempts to answer by engaging in the daily is *what needs to be done today*. This can be seen in the team's stance on `INBOX`: does a new item change priorities as they were previously agreed to be? Are there new fires to be extinguished or can work proceed as planned?


### The daily can be used as a tool for continuous improvement {#daily-as-kaizen}

Taken another way, the daily is an event for the team to potentially *reflect at* the activity system. This means the team can take the opportunity to see whether the modelling makes sense for whatever is going on at a given moment. If tension between "reality" and what the modelling tells the team arises, corrections can be taken immediately. This is in contrast to the conception of a daily which was presented as an answer to **TRQ1**, where the opportunity for change presents itself outside the daily in intervention-based *retrospectives*.

### The practice of a daily can inform software development activities

The daily is a crisscross network of interdependencies to activities and thus practices of software development.

- how software is done is affected by the daily (because of the opportunity for creating new shared meanings for items)
- what is done is affected by the daily (because of the opportunity for changing priorities)
- we can change those practices by changing the modelling of the system and this can happen in the daily


## Theoretical implications

### Overcoming tensions vs extending knowledge objects

In \ref{process-of-innovation} we delimited the scope of this study to the activity theoretical perspective, in which we consider the process of innovation as that of collaborative contradiction resolution. This was a choice fitting for the investigation of the daily practice as the focal element, but there is another option. Consider the possibility where we wanted to instead investigate the specific way the team uses the kanban boards as a knowledge object and to refine their understanding of the activities which are placed outside the daily but modelled within. In this case we could've done well by picking the *conceptual artefact* based model of knowledge building by \citet{bereiter2002education}, contrasted to Engestr√∂m's model we used here by \citet{hakkarainen2004communities}.
