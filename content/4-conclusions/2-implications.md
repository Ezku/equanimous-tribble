# Implications of the study

The following section discusses the implications of this study. Implications are divided into practical implications, where views and recommendations on the design of practices on continuous improvement in software development are shared, and theoretical implications which consider directions of future research based on results from this study.

## Practical implications

- The dailies were an arena for expansive learning to take place
- The research suggests that expansive learning may occur over days in a continuous process
  - this is in contrast to what is suggested by the agile literature: that new input to the development process and improvement of the ways of work would optimally happen in "interventions" every couple of weeks
  - if such interventionary measure *are* wanted, perhaps their design may be aided by leveraging existing research in the field of activity theory, such as Engestrom's ChangeLab methodology


Suggestions:

- **Focus on the journey of improvement.** Design for mechanisms which support change and learning, not enforcing static structures. There is no one right way to do things.
- **Provide an arena for collaboratively inspecting a workflow.** This serves the dual purpose of facilitating collaborative understanding of the work in practice and enabling identification of contradictions. Modelling of transformations on the practice benefits from an intersubjective understanding of the current state of practice.
- **Embrace disturbances as indicative of change potential.** Foster a culture in which failures, mistakes and contradictory demands may be brought to light as they occur. Structure practices in a way that they do not break down in the presence of disturbances, so that the disturbances do not need to be extinguished and may instead serve as fuel for collaborative learning.
- **Expect further contradictions.** Resistance to change is a real thing and is exerted by the part of practice you are trying to change, different parts of the same practice, and other interacting practices. Expect these sources of friction and be ready to address them in order to continue with a fruitful process of transformation.

How could the observed daily be improved with these guidelines?

### The daily reflect's the team's understanding of the process of software development

### The daily reflects the activity system

In section \ref{segments-in-depth} we observed how the team carries out a daily. We had the chance to see the position the team takes on the boards and items therein. What the boards contain are tasks or work that is potentially but not necessary intended to be completed by the team in the future. Each item is therefore a description of work, but its setting in the context of the boards affords the team an understanding of *how* this work will be completed.

Equipped with this knowledge, we can make the claim that the boards are a description of the team's understanding of the *activity system* that the team is embedded within and the items are tokens for *networks of activities* that occur within the system. For instance, a developer and QA have entirely different interpretations of the actions that a specific item implies should be taken, but they are modelled by the same item moving through the system description nonetheless.

Taking this idea further, not only are the boards and their arrangement a reflection of the activity system, but *the daily itself* is such a reflection as well. This is because, as shown in section \ref{relation-between-daily-and-boards}, the structure of a daily is afforded by the structure of the boards. The arrangement of the boards gives rise to an agenda for the daily, and the agenda may correspondingly be modified by a change to the arrangement.

#### Discovering the best thing to do

*How does the daily practice reflect the activity system as understood by the team?*

A key question that the team attempts to answer by engaging in the daily is *what needs to be done today*. This can be seen in the team's stance on `INBOX`: does a new item change priorities as they were previously agreed to be? Are there new fires to be extinguished or can work proceed as planned?

### The daily can be used as a tool for continuous improvement {#daily-as-kaizen}

<!--
Taken another way, the daily is an event for the team to potentially *reflect at* the activity system. This means the team can take the opportunity to see whether the modelling makes sense for whatever is going on at a given moment. If tension between "reality" and what the modelling tells the team arises, corrections can be taken immediately. This is in contrast to the conception of a daily which was presented as an answer to **TRQ1**, where the opportunity for change presents itself outside the daily in intervention-based *retrospectives*.
-->

### The practice of a daily can inform software development activities

<!--

The daily is a crisscross network of interdependencies to activities and thus practices of software development.

- how software is done is affected by the daily (because of the opportunity for creating new shared meanings for items)
- what is done is affected by the daily (because of the opportunity for changing priorities)
- we can change those practices by changing the modelling of the system and this can happen in the daily
-->

## Theoretical implications

### Investigating software development from an activity theoretical perspective

- The research suggests that the use of activity theory to describe practices in the field of software development has explanatory power
-

### Overcoming tensions vs extending knowledge objects

In \ref{process-of-innovation} we delimited the scope of this study to the activity theoretical perspective, in which we consider the process of innovation as that of collaborative contradiction resolution. This was a choice fitting for the investigation of the daily practice as the focal element, but there is another option. Consider the possibility where we wanted to instead investigate the specific way the team uses the kanban boards as a knowledge object and to refine their understanding of the activities which are placed outside the daily but modelled within. In this case we could've done well by picking the *conceptual artefact* based model of knowledge building by \citet{bereiter2002education}, contrasted to Engestr√∂m's model we used here by \citet{hakkarainen2004communities}. A study where the conceptual artefacts are taken in focus could, for instance, look deeper into the team's use of their tools and how they reflect the conceptual models in use.
