# Implications of the study

The following section discusses the implications of this study. Implications are divided into practical implications, where views and recommendations on the design of practices on continuous improvement in software development are shared, and theoretical implications which consider directions of future research based on results from this study.

## Practical implications

The nature of findings is in part to challenge received views and informing and improving practice \cite{robinson2007ethnographically}. It may be considered unlikely that a receiver of the account of practice elaborated in this study would wish to imitate the practice directly. The researcher hopes that the account may challenge the standard view of both the usefulness of a daily and the application of kanban in software development. Perhaps a receiver will be able to draw inspiration from the claimed benefits of a different kind of daily and be able to use this to structure their own practice; or perhaps they will be reminded of latent opportunities for continuous improvement.

It would be false to claim the observed daily practice as an unqualified success. The study showed that there is value in spending time on a daily, but perhaps the observed daily was still too long, too unfocused, and too neglecting of the value of its participants' time. The fact that participants were observed anxious to move forward from segment to segment could be interpreted as an indicator of boredom or dissatisfaction. The actions taken in dailies also did not have an especially democratic nature, with manager participants taking a large degree of the initiative, which again might be taken antithetical to aims of self-directed action espoused in lean.

Considering the mentioned drawbacks and the obvious situated nature of a specific practice, recommending any of the concrete methods in use in the observed daily would be folly. However, the research points out specific qualities and aims which the observed daily reflected at least to a degree and which would be beneficial for those applying lean principles to keep in mind. The researcher humbly submits the following suggestions for consideration.

- Focus on the journey of improvement.
- Provide an arena for collaboratively inspecting a workflow.
- Embrace disturbances as indicative of change potential.
- Expect further contradictions.

Focus on the ability to change and the collaborative journey to improvement. Because there is no one right way to do things, the important thing is not to determine such a way and monitor whether your execution is on target. Instead, it is beneficial to design for mechanisms which support change and learning, not enforcing static structures.

A modelling of your team's workflow does little to help the team improve if there is no time and place to interpret and react to what the modelling is telling you. Provide an arena for workflow to be inspected collaboratively. Such an arena serves the dual purpose of facilitating the creation of collaborative understanding of the work in practice and enabling identification of contradictions. A resulting intersubjective understanding of the current state of practice should help out in being able to collaboratively model transformations of the practice.

Improvement feeds on disturbances. Foster a culture in which failures, mistakes and contradictory demands may be brought to light as they occur. Structure practices in such a way that they do not break down in the presence of disturbances, so that the disturbances do not need to be extinguished and may instead serve as fuel for collaborative learning.

There will be resistance to change. It manifests through contradictions exerted by the part of practice you are trying to change, different parts of the same practice, and other interacting practices. Expect these sources of friction and be ready to address them in order to continue with a fruitful process of transformation. Yielding at the first sign of opposition is not a recipe for affecting change. Instead, leverage collaborative capability to transform ways of doing and thinking – this is how effective change is achieved, not through a process of imposition which will leave latent contradictions unresolved.

These suggestions are a detachment from the way agile software development might be taught to practitioners. They caution against cargo cult and dogma, asking that a practitioner understand why they are doing what they do and how to go about changing their ways of operating. Yet they also communicate that directions of improvement are fundamentally found in collaborative action, and that the acts of improvement also need to be taken collaboratively. The suggestions offer lean practitioners reminders on constraints and realities which may support development of ways of working.

### The daily reflect's the team's understanding of the process of software development

### The daily reflects the activity system

In section \ref{segments-in-depth} we observed how the team carries out a daily. We had the chance to see the position the team takes on the boards and items therein. What the boards contain are tasks or work that is potentially but not necessary intended to be completed by the team in the future. Each item is therefore a description of work, but its setting in the context of the boards affords the team an understanding of *how* this work will be completed.

Equipped with this knowledge, we can make the claim that the boards are a description of the team's understanding of the *activity system* that the team is embedded within and the items are tokens for *networks of activities* that occur within the system. For instance, a developer and QA have entirely different interpretations of the actions that a specific item implies should be taken, but they are modelled by the same item moving through the system description nonetheless.

Taking this idea further, not only are the boards and their arrangement a reflection of the activity system, but *the daily itself* is such a reflection as well. This is because, as shown in section \ref{relation-between-daily-and-boards}, the structure of a daily is afforded by the structure of the boards. The arrangement of the boards gives rise to an agenda for the daily, and the agenda may correspondingly be modified by a change to the arrangement.

#### Discovering the best thing to do

*How does the daily practice reflect the activity system as understood by the team?*

A key question that the team attempts to answer by engaging in the daily is *what needs to be done today*. This can be seen in the team's stance on `INBOX`: does a new item change priorities as they were previously agreed to be? Are there new fires to be extinguished or can work proceed as planned?


### The daily can be used as a tool for continuous improvement {#daily-as-kaizen}

Taken another way, the daily is an event for the team to potentially *reflect at* the activity system. This means the team can take the opportunity to see whether the modelling makes sense for whatever is going on at a given moment. If tension between "reality" and what the modelling tells the team arises, corrections can be taken immediately. This is in contrast to the conception of a daily which was presented as an answer to **TRQ1**, where the opportunity for change presents itself outside the daily in intervention-based *retrospectives*.

### The practice of a daily can inform software development activities

The daily is a crisscross network of interdependencies to activities and thus practices of software development.

- how software is done is affected by the daily (because of the opportunity for creating new shared meanings for items)
- what is done is affected by the daily (because of the opportunity for changing priorities)
- we can change those practices by changing the modelling of the system and this can happen in the daily

## Theoretical implications

The theoretical objective of this study was to gain an understanding of how specific practices in software development may be seen as contributive to a process of continuous and collaborative improvement. An activity theoretical perspective of practices was applied to further this goal such that it could not only explain empirical data but serve as a unifying measure in evaluating practices described in the agile and lean discourses of software development.

The dailies were seen as an arena for expansive learning to take place. The research suggests that expansive learning within lean software development may occur over a time span of days in a continuous process. This is in contrast to the timeboxed "sprint" approach from agile literature, which implies that new input to the process and improvement of the ways of work should happen in interventionary reflection sessions every couple of weeks. If such measures *are* wanted, perhaps their design may be aided by leveraging existing research on interventions from the field of activity theory, such as the ChangeLab method by \citet{engestrom1996change}.


- The research suggests that the use of activity theory to describe practices in the field of software development has explanatory power
  - we found that the degree to which a practice supported collaborative learning could be analysed by identifying episodes of disturbance which reflected steps in the expansive learning cycle

- what was described is the means by which the practice of a daily may support a team's self-directed change of its own practices
- this was linked to innovation and further to continuous improvement by a theoretical construction
- however, the linkage provided is only theoretical and, hopefully, plausible for the receiver: a causal link to *waste reduction* in the process of software development was not the objective of this study
- during the observation theory we found *fragments* of different expansive learning cycles in different phases which suggests that over time, some of these cycles run to completion while some may not
  - a more longitudinal research could reveal more
- the research took as a central construct the kanban system used by the team and the empirical data was interpreted in a way that supports the claim that the system's malleability was an affordance for the team's ability to affect transformations on their practices
  - the theoretical framework also conceptualised the daily practice as it exists in agile as a significantly more constrained and rules-delineated event, such that it would be unlikely to exhibit the kinds of qualities we fpund in the observed dailies
  - an idea of the degree to which it is the use of a kanban system that enables a team to have a qualitatively different kind of daily, with a different objective, and thus to learn like this could be reached by investigating occurrence of disturbances in a more traditionally *Scrum* kind of daily


- In \ref{process-of-innovation} we delimited the scope of this study to the activity theoretical perspective, in which we consider the process of innovation as that of collaborative contradiction resolution.
- This was a choice fitting for the investigation of the daily practice as the focal element, but there is another option.
- Consider the possibility where we wanted to instead investigate the specific way the team uses the kanban boards as a knowledge object.
- In this case we could've done well by picking the *conceptual artefact* based model of knowledge building by \citet{bereiter2002education}, contrasted to Engeström's model by \citet{hakkarainen2004communities}.
- A study where the conceptual artefacts are taken in focus could, for instance, look deeper into the team's use of their tools and how they reflect the conceptual models in use.

- Further study would be required to gain insight into how a daily-like event should be used and structured to optimal benefit and which situational factors affect choices around structuring.
- Open directions of questioning include the assumption of a *daily* event, or whether an alternate pacing should be considered, along with whether this choice affects the ways in which disturbances and transformations crop up.
