## Why would you run a daily?

It is easy to criticise how the daily might not be an effective use of its participants' time. They are synchronous, meaning participants must be present at the same time, and take up a significant slice of one's working day as observed in section \ref{daily-structure}. This means they carry a large cost that needs to be offset by benefits. Furthermore, the benefits are not obvious: no customer is served by time the team spends in a daily, no code is written, no bugs are fixed, no features implemented. Because no tangible "work" gets done, the only justifiable value of dailies is in enhancing the organisation's effectiveness, meaning capability for value-adding service delivery.

Based on results of the empirical study in \ref{empirical-findings}, I argue that the use of a daily is in the co-creation of knowledge situated in the team.
