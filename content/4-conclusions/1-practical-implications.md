# Practical implications

- Dailies are a huge cost: they are synchronous and take up a significant slice of developers' time
- Because no tangible "work" gets done, the only justifiable use of dailies is the potential for knowledge transfer and creation
- Exposition on the mechanisms of knowledge creation within dailies will allow organizations to structure their use of the time taken for more of the intangible benefits desired
