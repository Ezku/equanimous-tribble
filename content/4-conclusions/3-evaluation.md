# Evaluation

The form of this study is a literature review combined with an empirical case study. This section evaluates the study from perspectives of credibility (\ref{credibility}) and inherent limitations (\ref{limitations}).

## Credibility, transferability, dependability and confirmability {#credibility}

The research in this thesis encompasses a qualitative \citep{creswell2009research} case study \citep{eisenhardt1989building} with an ethnographic approach \citep{lecompte1982problems}.  \citet{lincoln1985naturalistic} suggest that qualitative studies in general be evaluated on criterias of credibility, transferability, dependability and confirmability. \citet{lecompte1982problems} define the problems of ethnographic research specifically to lie in the capability to establish properties of reliability and validity, which will be linked to the four aforementioned properties in this section.

Credibility is the quality of truthfulness and persuasiveness in causalities and relationships inferred in a study. \citep{lincoln1985naturalistic} The reasoning in this study followed an abductive inference to the best explanation \citep{dubois2002systematic}, in which an iterative interplay between theoretical framework and empirical analysis affords the search of a theory with suitable explanatory power. This is consistent with descriptions of case study research process in general \citep{eisenhardt1989building} and ethnographical studies specifically \citep{lecompte1982problems}.


- the extent to which conclusions represent reality is called validity by \citet{lecompte1982problems}, who divide it into categories of internal and external validity
  - whether constructs devised by researchers represent categories of human experience that occur
  - internal validity is the extent to which observations are authentic representations
  - external validity is the degree to which representations may be compared legitimately across groups


Transferability \citep{lincoln1985naturalistic}
- the generalizability of the findings,
- i.e. whether the findings can be applied in other contexts and to other research subjects

in ethnographical research this is supported by - \citet{lecompte1982problems}
- Comparability (requires that the ethnographer delineate the characteristics of the group studied or constructs generated so that they can serve as a basis for comparison with other groups)
- translatability (assumes that research methods, analytic categories, and characteristics of phenomena and groups are identified so explicitly that comparisons can be conducted confidently)



Transferability of findings in qualitative research
- cannot be determined by the evaluator of the study that is transferred
- instead by the receiver of the evaluation \citep{eisenhardt1989building,guba1989fourth}

\citep{lincoln1985naturalistic}
- enabling receiver of the evaluation to assess applicability to other context requires thick description of the research context, theory, methods and findings of the study

Dependability:
- the consistency of the study with the aim of providing results independent from the researcher’s identity \citep{guba1989fourth}
- \citet{lecompte1982problems} discuss this as the problem of reliability:
  - external reliability: would independent researchers discover the same phenomena
  - internal reliability: degree to which other researchers would match data with previously generated constructs in the same way
  - external reliability
    - reports must clearly identify the researcher's role and status within the group
    - threats to reliability by informant bias are handled by careful description of those who provided the data
    - delineation of physical, social and interpersonal contexts enhance replicability of ethnographic studies
    - outlining theoretical premises that inform and shape the research facilitates replication
    - Identify and describe strategies used to collect data
  - internal reliability
    - Low-inference descriptors: - As concrete and precises as possible
    - Mechanically recorded data: - Use of observational techniques that record as much as possible

Confirmability \citep{guba1989fourth}
- the neutrality of the study
- freedom from bias, values and prejudice
- Justification of confirmability
  - ensuring that the findings can be traced to the data: audit trail of inference \citep{lincoln1985naturalistic}
  - this is afforded by the rich description of the empirical study results










## Limitations of the study {#limitations}

- This is an ethnographical study
  - What does that imply for limitations?
  - What did we not get when we did things this way?

- On the other hand, what _did_ we get?
  - translatability

- We could not show a causal link to waste reduction
- The audio recordings were not sufficient to show how manipulations of the shared artefacts were done or how they affected the ongoings

- the researcher was an established member of the community of practice under investigation, which provided benefits in that the observation situation was more natural and the researcher could draw on more background to make his interpretations of ongoings
  - there are drawbacks, however
  - f the researcher is part of the community of practice, how do would they be able to consider anything 'strange'? Both challenges and advantages. \cite{robinson2007ethnographically}
    - Tension involved in moving between two worlds: understanding, yet considering strange
    - Benefits
      + acceptance by 'tribe'
      + not getting overwhelmed when following activity

Nature of findings: \cite{robinson2007ethnographically}
- Problems and solutions
    - "There is no expectation that our answers provide direct solutions to speciWc problems."
    - "In some cases, we have uncovered problems, but investi- gation of the solutions lies outside our immediate study."
- Challenging received views
    + Knowing the actuality of software development practice, rather than the received view, is an essential prerequisite to the design of a tool, technique, or methodology to support that practice
    - "Challenging received views can inform and improve practice."
- Providing rich accounts of practice
    – "Such accounts thus provide practitioners with a mirror of their practice which might support their activities as ‘reXec- tive practitioners’"

Usefulness of approach: \cite{robinson2007ethnographically}
- Cannot address questions based on hypotheses derived from theories
=> indeed we could not use this research approach to discover whether waste was "actually" reduced


### \citep{lecompte1982problems} Problems of reliability and validity in ethnographic

reliability in ethnographic research
- dependent on resolution of external and internal design problems
- external reliability: would independent researchers discover the same phenomena
- internal reliability: degree to which other researchers would match data with previously generated constructs in the same way

#### Formulation of problems

Experimentation:
- credibility of research design and power of treatment are established by eliminating extraneous factors
Ethnography:
- precludes precise control of so-called extraneous factors

#### Nature of goals

Ethnographers
- describe systematically the characteristics of phenomena
- generate and refine conceptual categories
Experimental research
- tests causal propositions developed externally to the research site
- test the strength or power of causes on effects

#### Application of results

- the aim in application is for comparability and translatability of findings

- Descriptive tool rather than prescriptive
- Care must be taken in generalizing the descriptions
