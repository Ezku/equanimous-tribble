## Limitations of the study

- This is an ethnographical study
  - What does that imply for limitations?
  - What did we not get when we did things this way?

- On the other hand, what _did_ we get?
  - translatability

- We could not show a causal link to waste reduction
- The audio recordings were not sufficient to show how manipulations of the shared artefacts were done or how they affected the ongoings

- the researcher was an established member of the community of practice under investigation, which provided benefits in that the observation situation was more natural and the researcher could draw on more background to make his interpretations of ongoings
  - there are drawbacks, however
  - f the researcher is part of the community of practice, how do would they be able to consider anything 'strange'? Both challenges and advantages. \cite{robinson2007ethnographically}
    - Tension involved in moving between two worlds: understanding, yet considering strange
    - Benefits
      + acceptance by 'tribe'
      + not getting overwhelmed when following activity

Nature of findings: \cite{robinson2007ethnographically}
- Problems and solutions
    - "There is no expectation that our answers provide direct solutions to speciWc problems."
    - "In some cases, we have uncovered problems, but investi- gation of the solutions lies outside our immediate study."
- Challenging received views
    + Knowing the actuality of software development practice, rather than the received view, is an essential prerequisite to the design of a tool, technique, or methodology to support that practice
    - "Challenging received views can inform and improve practice."
- Providing rich accounts of practice
    – "Such accounts thus provide practitioners with a mirror of their practice which might support their activities as ‘reXec- tive practitioners’"

Usefulness of approach: \cite{robinson2007ethnographically}
- Cannot address questions based on hypotheses derived from theories
=> indeed we could not use this research approach to discover whether waste was "actually" reduced


### \citep{lecompte1982problems} Problems of reliability and validity in ethnographic

reliability in ethnographic research
- dependent on resolution of external and internal design problems
- external reliability: would independent researchers discover the same phenomena
- internal reliability: degree to which other researchers would match data with previously generated constructs in the same way

#### Formulation of problems

Experimentation:
- credibility of research design and power of treatment are established by eliminating extraneous factors
Ethnography:
- precludes precise control of so-called extraneous factors

#### Nature of goals

Ethnographers
- describe systematically the characteristics of phenomena
- generate and refine conceptual categories
Experimental research
- tests causal propositions developed externally to the research site
- test the strength or power of causes on effects

#### Application of results

- the aim in application is for comparability and translatability of findings

- Descriptive tool rather than prescriptive
- Care must be taken in generalizing the descriptions
