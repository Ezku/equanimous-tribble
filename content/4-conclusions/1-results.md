## The daily reflects the activity system

In section \ref{segments-in-depth} we observed how the team carries out a daily. We had the chance to see the position the team takes on the boards and items therein.

What the boards contain are tasks or work that is potentially but not necessary intended to be completed by the team in the future. Each item is therefore a description of work, but its setting in the context of the boards affords the team an understanding of *how* this work will be completed. Therefore, the boards are a description of the team's understanding of the *activity system* that the team is embedded within and the items are tokens for *networks of activities* that occur within the system. For instance, a developer and QA have entirely different interpretations of the actions that a specific item implies should be taken, but they are modelled by the same item moving through the system description nonetheless.

Taking this idea further, not only are the boards and their arrangement a reflection of the activity system, but *the daily itself* is such a reflection as well. This is because, as shown in section \ref{relation-between-daily-and-boards}, the structure of a daily is afforded by the structure of the boards. The arrangement of the boards gives rise to an agenda for the daily, and the agenda may correspondingly be modified by a change to the arrangement.

## The daily can be used as a tool for continuous improvement {daily-as-kaizen}

Taken another way, the daily is an event for the team to potentially *reflect at* the activity system. This means the team can take the opportunity to see whether the modelling makes sense for whatever is going on at a given moment. If tension between "reality" and what the modelling tells the team arises, corrections can be taken immediately. This is in contrast to the conception of a daily which was presented as an answer to **TRQ1**, where the opportunity for change presents itself outside the daily in intervention-based *retrospectives*.

## The practice of a daily can inform software development activities

The daily is a crisscross network of interdependencies to activities and thus practices of software development.

- how software is done is affected by the daily (because of the opportunity for creating new shared meanings for items)
- what is done is affected by the daily (because of the opportunity for changing priorities)
- we can change those practices by changing the modelling of the system and this can happen in the daily
