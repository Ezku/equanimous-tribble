## Answers to the empirical research questions

> **ERQ1**: How is the observed daily positioned with regard to descriptions of Scrum daily and kanban systems in the theory?

A daily in the Scrum methodology, as described in \ref{scrum-daily}, is a short, all-hands meeting held every day. The context of a daily is the ongoing development iteration, or sprint, and the topic will be predefined by the sprint's agenda. The daily's function is defined by the responsibilities of each team member attending: to discuss progress of work items and to communicate any potential impediments. The goal is thus to "keep the ball moving", focus on the essentials of what needs to be done and empower the team members to support each other in the process.

The observed practice is a daily, but it is decidedly not a Scrum one. On the very surface of things, with an average duration of 35 minutes (\ref{durations-and-segments}) the daily is significantly longer than the 15 minutes recommended for Scrum. Furthermore, the context of the daily is not a sprint with a fixed agenda, but instead a collection of interrelated, ongoing development processes. Some of these processes are best described as cycles or iterations with a predefined start and conclusion, but not all. The daily was segmented by the use of kanban boards that were heterogenous in structure, which reflected the team's pluralistic understanding of their work.

In terms of absolute time expenditure by segment, we can conclude that the daily has the following main functions: accounting for new information (in the `INBOX` segment), addressing urgent, non-planned work (`FIRES` segment), relating the general status of work, scheduling and impediments (`INTRO`), and keeping track of "discussions", such as improvement of workflows (`OUTBOX`).  Secondary functions, which occurred more rarely but on which significant time was spent per occurrence, consist of development cycle reviews and planning (`BOARD OVERVIEW`, `CYCLES`). Auxiliary functions would include keeping track of non-software-development work, work required for customer relations, and urgent but non-critical work.

In the literature, kanban systems are a visual work coordination device which allow for inspecting the workflow, or the process through which work items pass through the system. Its purpose is to allow those completing the work to identify the work to be done and act on this information swiftly. This speeds up delivery and enhances learning, while allowing identification of waste throughout the process. A kanban system is intended to be improved upon in a process of continuous improvement, which is collaborative in nature to avoid suboptimization. The use of kanban requires supporting practices, such as those from agile methodologies.

Outside the daily, the team members use the work items represented in their virtual kanban boards to determine what they should be working on at any given time. In section \ref{typical-segments} we observed that the kanban boards encode relevant workflows when they are understood, such as software development work. As we saw in section \ref{structural-change}, the layout and structure of the boards is linked to how the daily plays out and is adjusted in the daily. Critically, the members' understanding of *how* the boards are used to communicate what there is to be done is shaped during the daily. The team applies the agile practice of a daily to support their collaborative use of a kanban system.

The team is careful to limit their work in progress as much as they can, but realise that there is some work that is urgent enough to be expedited even at the cost of increasing the amount of things being worked on concurrently. The team's use of the `INBOX` is a mechanism for segregating possible work items into those that can be scheduled for later and those that must be reacted to immediately. Because the team continuously handles any urgent but unplanned work in the `FIRES` segment, they are well equipped for being able to see a category of waste that might be called "rework"; they are aware of their past mistakes and the costs incurred due to addressing them. Finally, the team has a habit of being explicit about their process and its collaborative improvement. The `OUTBOX` segment serves as a means of keeping track of drives for improvement as well as explicating any outcomes thereof.

In summary, the use of a kanban system with the practice of a daily allows the team to apply virtually all of the kanban principles, which taken together support the lean goal of continuous improvement. The daily also allows the team to accept feedback and adjust their priorities on work to be completed on a day-to-day basis. This distinction from the Scrum daily may be seen as significant, redefining the object of activity from "progress of predefined work items" to "redefining work and its priorities". It comes at a cost, however, in that the observed dailies were a significantly larger expenditure in terms of the development team's time.

## Answer to the research problem

> **RP:** How can the practice of a daily in conjunction with a kanban system support continuous improvement?

The practice of a daily in conjunction with a kanban system supports continuous improvement in a software development team by providing a structure in which the kanban system is observed, new input can be considered and waste may be identified collaboratively, and by serving as a context in which failures in the practice may be brought up and through a process of expansive learning help the team transform the practice.

The theoretical framework describes continuous improvement in practice as a process of collaborative and continuous innovation. Innovation is understood as successive surfacing and resolution of contradictions in a practice by transforming the team's object of activity and thus the practice itself. In the empirical study, the practice of a daily was established and disturbances in the practice were observed, linking them to transformations in the object of activity that the team encoded as changes to the kanban system.

## Conclusions

The objective of the thesis was to describe the use of a daily practice in conjunction with the use of a kanban system such that the concept of a daily itself might be expanded upon from dictates of agile software methodology. This was done by searching for evidence that such a use of the daily would support the lean goal of continuous improvement, as the use of a kanban system also does. The theoretical objective was to find a way to describe the daily in such a way as to make possible the identification of mechanisms supporting continuous improvement, which was served by the use of an activity theoretical framing of the daily activities. The empirical study was conducted to further this line of argumentation.

The use of a kanban system could be observed to provide a structure for the daily practice. The object of the daily activity was a visualization of work in the kanban system, with the objective of grooming new input and collaboratively responding to changing situations and priorities by manipulating kanban tokens. An activity theoretical model of expansive learning was offered as an explanatory model for how continuous improvement occurs. Disturbances that reflect different levels of contradictions in the practice were identified as necessary for the process of improvement.

The analysis in this thesis contributes to efforts of devising and implementing practices based on lean software development, which have the goal of continuous improvement. The results suggest that such practices may benefit from analysis on how they enable the surfacing of disturbances and transformations of the contradictions implied by them.
