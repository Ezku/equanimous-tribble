## Answers to the empirical research questions

> **ERQ1**: How is the observed daily positioned with regard to descriptions of Scrum daily and kanban systems in the theory?

A daily in the Scrum methodology, as described in \ref{scrum-daily}, is a short, all-hands meeting held every day. The context of a daily is the ongoing development iteration, or sprint, and the topic will be predefined by the sprint's agenda. The daily's function is defined by the responsibilities of each team member attending: to discuss progress of work items and to communicate any potential impediments. The goal is thus to "keep the ball moving", focus on the essentials of what needs to be done and empower the team members to support each other in the process.

The observed practice is a daily, but it is decidedly not a Scrum one. On the very surface of things, with an average duration of 35 minutes (\ref{durations-and-segments}) the daily is significantly longer than the 15 minutes recommended for Scrum. Furthermore, the context of the daily is not a sprint with a fixed agenda, but instead a collection of interrelated, ongoing development processes. Some of these processes are best described as cycles or iterations with a predefined start and conclusion, but not all. The daily was segmented by the use of kanban boards that were heterogenous in structure, which reflected the team's pluralistic understanding of their work.

In terms of absolute time expenditure by segment, we can conclude that the daily has the following main functions: accounting for new information (in the `INBOX` segment), addressing urgent, non-planned work (`FIRES` segment), relating the general status of work, scheduling and impediments (`INTRO`), and keeping track of "discussions", such as improvement of workflows (`OUTBOX`).  Secondary functions, which occurred more rarely but on which significant time was spent per occurrence, consist of development cycle reviews and planning (`BOARD OVERVIEW`, `CYCLES`). Auxiliary functions would include keeping track of non-software-development work, work required for customer relations, and urgent but non-critical work.

In the literature, kanban systems are a visual work coordination device which allow for inspecting the workflow, or the process through which work items pass through the system. Its purpose is to allow those completing the work to identify the work to be done and act on this information swiftly. This speeds up delivery and enhances learning, while allowing identification of waste throughout the process. A kanban system is intended to be improved upon in a process of continuous improvement, which is collaborative in nature to avoid suboptimization. The use of kanban requires supporting practices, such as those from agile methodologies.

<!--
Kanban system
- Visualize the workflow
- Limit work in progress
- measure and manage flow
- make process policies explicit
- improve collaboratively
- not a standalone practice but requires support
- supports ability to see waste

Outside the daily, the team members use the work items represented in their virtual kanban boards to determine what they should be working on at any given time. In section \ref{segments-in-depth} we observed that the kanban boards encode relevant workflows when they are understood, such as software development work. As we saw in section \ref{relation-between-daily-and-boards}, the layout and structure of the boards is linked to how the daily plays out and is adjusted in the daily. Critically, the members' understanding of *how* the boards are used to communicate what there is to be done is shaped during the daily. The team applies the agile practice of a daily to support their collaborative use of a kanban system.

The team is careful to limit their work in progress as much as they can, but realise that there is some work that is urgent enough to be expedited even at the cost of increasing the amount of things being worked on concurrently. The team's use of the `INBOX` is a mechanism for segregating possible work items into those that can be scheduled for later and those that must be reacted to immediately. Because the team continuously handles any urgent but unplanned work in the `FIRES` segment, they are well equipped for being able to see a category of waste that might be called "rework"; they are aware of their past mistakes and the costs incurred due to addressing them. Finally, the team has a habit of being explicit about their process and its collaborative improvement. The `OUTBOX` segment serves as a means of keeping track of drives for improvement as well as explicating any outcomes thereof.

In summary, the use of a kanban system with the practice of a daily allows the team to apply virtually all of the kanban principles, which taken together support the lean goal of continuous improvement. The daily also allows the team to accept feedback and adjust their priorities on work to be completed on a day-to-day basis. This distinction from the Scrum daily may be seen as significant, redefining the object of activity from "progress of predefined work items" to "redefining work and its priorities". It comes at a cost, however, in that the observed dailies were a significantly larger expenditure in terms of the development team's time.
