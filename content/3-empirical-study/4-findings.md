# Empirical findings {#empirical-findings}

This section presents empirical findings based on which we will answer the empirical research questions from \ref{empirical-research-questions}. To settle **ERQ1**, in \ref{daily-structure} we describe the structure of a daily and link this structure to the use and arrangement of kanban boards.

## How is the daily structured {#daily-structure}

This section describes the structure of a daily as it appears based on the segment analysis described in \ref{research-methodology}. No two dailies followed exactly the same structure, but there were clear tendencies to be observed. Let us consider daily `03` as a prototypical example. The daily's segment outline can be seen in table \ref{daily-03-outline}.

Segment         | Duration
----------------+---------
INTRO	          | 00:10:45
INBOX	          | 00:01:45
FIRES	          | 00:04:05
PRIORITY LANE	  | 00:03:30
OUTBOX	        | 00:03:20
