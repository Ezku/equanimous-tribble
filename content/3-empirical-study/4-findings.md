This section presents empirical findings based on which we will answer the empirical research questions from section \ref{empirical-research-questions}. To settle **ERQ1**, in \ref{daily-structure} we describe the structure of a daily and link this structure to the use and arrangement of kanban boards.

## How is the daily structured? {#daily-structure}

This section describes the structure of a daily as it appears based on the segment analysis described in \ref{research-methodology}. No two dailies followed exactly the same structure, but there were clear tendencies to be observed. Let us consider daily `03` as a prototypical example. The daily's segment outline can be seen in table \ref{daily-03-outline}.

**Segment**        | **Duration**
-------------------+---------
INTRO	             | 00:10:45
INBOX	             | 00:01:45
FIRES	             | 00:04:05
PRIORITY LANE	     | 00:03:30
OUTBOX	           | 00:03:20
QUESTIONS	         | 00:02:00
BOARD OVERVIEW	   | 00:02:13
**Total duration** | 00:28:18

### Typical segments in depth

#### Introduction

The daily starts with an `INTRO` segment after making sure everyone is accounted for. It's noted that a team member has been absent for a while and that is affecting the team's capability of responding to fires. The team also takes issue with the state of communication between them and another team.

02:30
:   "Apparently it seems to be some ... hard to reach between business and marketing now, so–" (`D1`, referring to events from before the daily)
:   "You mean sales and marketing" (`M1`, correcting `D1`'s expression of the overall team structure)
02:41
:   "I'm just saying that we're not alone" (`D1` referring to difficulties shared with the team on a previous occasion)
02:58
:   "And I felt, it was like .. difficult" (`D1` starting to relate the experience)
03:01
:   "There's like .. two walls in between [..]" (`D2` continuing the sentiment metaphorically)
03:10
:   "So `M1` can you take down the walls or?" (`D3` asking for help in resolving the difficulties)
:   "Yes yes. `M2` comes back, we will shuffle the rooms anyway" (`M1`, referring to concrete workspace arrangements)

We can observe that the exchange is rich in history and context. Discussions from what appear to be previous dailies are referenced, as well as more immediate occurrences from the same day. The team seems content to describe the situation on a very abstract level, which could point to an understanding of concrete experiences already having been shared. The tension appears to be relieved by an explicit plea for help and a corresponding assurance that very concrete actions will be taken, despite the metaphorical level of discussion so far. Taken together, we see that the team uses the opportunity for coming together to discuss their woes and to find ways for recourse.

PRIORITY LANE | Priority lane
OUTBOX        | OUTBOX (ska diskuteras snart)
