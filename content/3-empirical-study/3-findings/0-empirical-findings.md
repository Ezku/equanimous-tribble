# Empirical findings {#empirical-findings}

This section presents empirical findings based on which we will answer the empirical research questions from section \ref{empirical-research-questions}. To settle **ERQ1**, we describe the structure of a daily and link change in that daily structure to corresponding change in kanban boards in sections \ref{typical-segments}  and \ref{structural-change}. **ERQ2** is covered in \ref{daily-change} by investigating activity episodes where contradictions occur, and the subsequent transformations of those contradictions.
