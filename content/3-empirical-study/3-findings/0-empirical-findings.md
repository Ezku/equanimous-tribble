# Empirical findings {#empirical-findings}

This section presents empirical findings based on which we will answer the empirical research questions from section \ref{empirical-research-questions}. To settle **ERQ1**, we describe the structure of a daily and link change in that daily structure to corresponding change in kanban boards in sections \ref{typical-segments}  and \ref{structural-change}. **ERQ2** is covered by investigating activity episodes where contradictions occur in section \ref{episodes-of-contradiction}, and the subsequent transformations of those contradictions in section \ref{journeys-of-transformation}.

<!-- Moved here from ERQ2 body copy, possibly useable:

If the daily is to be considered a practice, engaging in a daily should somehow inform the next occasions this engagement is taken and manifest as observable change in the practice. In this section we will lay the ground for answering **ERQ2** by investigating whether and how this change happens.

Our inquiry will be twofold. First we will check the material for episodes of questioning, disturbance and contradiction to see if the system evidences potential for change. Second, we will see if this change potential is realised as transformations. Within practices, contradictions unfold and improvement tends to happen slowly and must be observed over a duration of time. Our observations on change will take the form of journeys of transformation, taking place over multiple dailies.
