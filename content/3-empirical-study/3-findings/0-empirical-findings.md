# Empirical findings {#empirical-findings}

This section presents empirical findings based on which we will answer the empirical research questions from section \ref{empirical-research-questions}. To settle **ERQ1**, in \ref{daily-structure} we describe the structure of a daily and link this structure to the use and arrangement of kanban boards. **ERQ2** is covered in \ref{daily-change} by investigating activity episodes where contradictions occur, and the subsequent transformations of those contradictions.
