## What a difference a daily makes {#daily-change}

In the previous section we looked into how a daily happens and what kinds of activities a daily constitutes. We were left with the open question of *change*. If the daily is to be considered a practice, engaging in a daily should somehow inform the next occasions this engagement is taken and manifest as observable change in the practice. In this section we will lay the ground for answering **ERQ2** by investigating whether and how this change happens.

Our inquiry will be twofold. First we will check the material for episodes of questioning, disturbance and contradiction to see if the system evidences potential for change. Second, we will see if this change potential is realised as transformations. Within practices, contradictions unfold and improvement tends to happen slowly and must be observed over a duration of time. Our observations on change will take the form of journeys of transformation, taking place over multiple dailies. Let's proceed with a brief overview on how the stories were collected and structured overall, before looking at the stories one by one.

### Episodes of contradiction {#episodes-of-contradiction}

### Journeys of transformation

In the introductory section the usefulness of a daily was set to question by the fact that it is not a software development activity in itself. To reiterate, no features are delivered, no bugs fixed and no customer served. Therefore, if a use for the daily is to be found, in that it somehow aids software development activities, the use must lie in the relation between the daily and other practices that _do_ constitute software development. From the episodes delineated in \ref{episodes-of-contradiction}, a set was chosen such that their orientation is *not* toward the daily and what happens within but impactful on the outside world. The most important 'story arcs', if you will, were extracted from their original context and presented here compressed form such that we may observe the structural tensions reflected and their resolution via a process of transformation.



#### We are swamped with fires, but are they really all equally important?

#### Minor change requests get in the way of overall progress, yet they're important

#### There is more than one kind of wishlist

#### The module release process is not working
