## What a difference a daily makes {#daily-change}

In the previous section we looked into how a daily happens and what kinds of activities a daily constitutes. We were left with the open question of *change*. If the daily is to be considered a practice, engaging in a daily should somehow inform the next occasions this engagement is taken and manifest as observable change in the practice. In this section we will lay the ground for answering **ERQ2** by investigating whether and how this change happens.

Our inquiry will be twofold. First we will check the material for episodes of questioning, disturbance and contradiction to see if the system evidences potential for change. Second, we will see if this change potential is realised as transformations. Within practices, contradictions unfold and improvement tends to happen slowly and must be observed over a duration of time. Our observations on change will take the form of journeys of transformation, taking place over multiple dailies. Let's proceed with a brief overview on how the stories were collected and structured overall, before looking at the stories one by one.

### Episodes of contradiction {#episodes-of-contradiction}

In section \ref{contradictions} we identified four different kinds of contradictions. In this section, occurrences the different contradictions are exemplified through individual episodes.

The first episode represents a primary contradiction with an immediate transformation.

#### Daily 04, `NON-FUNCTIONAL`

> 30:40
> :   "If we are skipping modules all the time, then we need to move non-functional on top of modules" (`M`)
> 30:46
> :   "Makes sense" (`D`)
> 30:47
> :   "Nice" (`M`)

A manager observes that the team's kanban boards are ordered such that the driver would be inclined to direct the team to the module continuum board at this point of the daily. However, going through that board is not seen to be of value for the team. The manager suggests that the board be moved out of the way, which the team accepts.

Not all primary contradictions afford such easy resolution. In the following fragment, two developers have an exchange reflecting a more fundamental tension.

#### Daily 14, `FIRES`

> 14:05
> :   "`D1`, this [fire] was here yesterday. Did you do anything about this?" (`D2`)
> :   "No" (`D1`)
> :   "Why not? Fires go always first." (`D2`)
> :   "Yeah, but I was also working on this [feature]" (`D1`)
> :   "But that's not a fire" (`D2`)
> :   "But it was in a stage [where] I didn't want to cut the work" (`D1`)

The very existence of work items categorised as fires is contradictory to the team's goals, as they call for attention and effort to be redirected. However, switching tasks from a feature under development represents a big cost, and apparently in this scenario a developer judged the cost too high. The other developer has no alternative but to accept the existence of these contradictory demands. In this case, there is no transformation to be suggested.



In this section we have seen disturbances in the daily practice that could be interpreted as reflecting contradictions of all the tiers from primary to quaternary, and also seen how a transformation to resolve the contradiction may nor may not come up and likewise may or may not be accepted.

The observations go to show that disturbances indeed do occur, and that they may be linked to transformations. However, we might collect and catalogue all of the individual disturbances but still not be much better off in our capability to understand the usefulness of them to the team. As described in section \ref{contradictions}, the fundamental usefulness lies in expansive transformations which happen on longer scales of time and over multiple episodes.

### Journeys of transformation

In the introductory section the usefulness of a daily was set to question by the fact that it is not a software development activity in itself. To reiterate, no features are delivered, no bugs fixed and no customer served. Therefore, if a use for the daily is to be found, in that it somehow aids software development activities, the use must lie in the relation between the daily and other practices that _do_ constitute software development. From the episodes delineated in \ref{episodes-of-contradiction}, a set was chosen such that their orientation is *not* toward the daily and what happens within but impactful on the outside world. The most important 'story arcs', if you will, were extracted from their original context and presented here compressed form such that we may observe the structural tensions reflected and their resolution via a process of transformation.
