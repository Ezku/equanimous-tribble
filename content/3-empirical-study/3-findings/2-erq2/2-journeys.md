## A transformational journey {#journey-of-transformation}

In the introductory section the usefulness of a daily was set to question by the fact that it is not a software development activity in itself. To reiterate, no features are delivered, no bugs fixed and no customer served. Therefore, if a use for the daily is to be found, in that it somehow aids software development activities, the use must lie in the relation between the daily and other practices that _do_ constitute software development.

From the episodes found in the empirical data, a set was chosen such that their orientation is *not* toward the daily and what happens within but impactful on the outside world. They were curated into journeys, episodes which appeared related through their contradictions and their transformations. In this section, we follow one of those journeys in depth. We're going to find out about what was discussed in \ref{structural-change}, segments which prominently appeared and then vanished at the latter part of the observation period.

### Trouble with work item categorization {#categorization-trouble}

The journey starts with the first time that the team can be observed to identify a problem with the way they handle inbox items. The standard procedure options apparent to the team are handling the new work item as either wishlist or fire. Here, they come across a work item that does not fit their conception of either. The item appears to the team as simultaneously less urgent than a fire yet more important than a wishlist item.

#### Daily 09, `INBOX`

> 05:10
> :   "Let's put this [new work item] on the 'required' list" (`D1`)
> 05:11
> :   "Okay, so... wishlist?" (`D2`)
<!-- > 05:16
> :   "Well..." (`D3`) -->
> 05:18
> :   "This is a funny thing to be putting on a wishlist" (`D2`)
> 05:18
> :   "But at least it's not a fire" (`D1`)

The team would not like to apply the standard procedures in place - either of them would be "a funny thing" to be doing. Taking note of this allows a latent primary contradiction to be surfaced. However, it is seen as merely a disturbance and no attempt at explanation or transformation follows: the resolution seems to be simply inaction, with the item left in the inbox for later. <!-- Is this true? -->

It takes a while for the issue to brew and mature. Five observed dailies (more than three weeks of calendar time) later we find the team discussing an outbox item which presents a similar conundrum. A work item appears which, paradoxically, will not need doing nor priorisation through wishlist until an additional external trigger.

#### Daily 14, `OUTBOX`

> 21:33
> :   "I guess wishlist or something would be inappropriate?" (`M1`, presenting wishlist as a precluded option)
> 21:50
> :   "Does [stakeholder] need the feature? ... Where is that feature?" (`D1`)
> :   "There's a follow-up feature request that doesn't need to be done." (`D2`)
> 22:05
> :   "Has it been through inbox?" (`D1`)
> :   "No. It's because that doesn't need to be done." (`D2`)

> 27:00
> :   "It says 'pending project, will be done when customer project requires'" (`D2`)
> 27:15
> :   "It's pending a project. There's no ... case." (`M1`, restating the intent after attention on the item is called for again)
> :   "Can we throw this to [a release cycle]?" (`D3`, providing a further option)
> :   "No, no, we won't be doing it" (`D1` with what can be taken as a note of frustration)

This time, instead of being satisfied with their declaration of an item being unfit for the apparent categories, the team does attempt to model the situation such that a suitable place could be found. The team's action demonstrates the existence and attempted resolution of a secondary contradiction, which goes as unresolved as the previous primary contradiction. Wherever the item is placed after this interaction, it's apparent the team isn't going to be satisfied. However, the team does clear one hurdle: now that the context of the discussion is `OUTBOX`, options other than wishlist and fire present themselves, and handling the work item as part of a release cycle is discussed.

### Addition of new boards as a transformation {#new-boards-as-transformation}

The scope of possible options is further expanded in the next daily. A work item that was initially processed as a fire is identified as actually not requiring action. Reference is made to the item's similarity with the one from the previous fragment. The work item depends on an external party, but is not impeded. It is done for a client but the scope is the whole product platform, and it's a technical customer need, but doesn't need to be resolved immediately.

#### Daily 15, `FIRES`

> 29:02
> :   "So how many weeks until [the client] need this?" (`D1`)
<!-- > :   "Impeded!" (`M1`) -->
> 29:10
> :   "Is this like a non-core, pending for project thing?" (`D1`)
<!-- > :   "No, impeded!" (`M1`) -->
> 29:28
> :   "Why not move this to [a release cycle]?" (`D2`)
> 29:48
> :   "Do we have a project for [client]? Can it be there?" (`D3`)
> 30:28
> :   "We need a box where to put these things. What's the name of the new box?" (`M1`)
> :   "'Moneybox'" (`D4`)
> 30:40
> :   "Isn't it kind of priority lane? It's customer needs" (`D5`)
> 30:45
> :   "How does this differ from any other feature request?" (`D2`)
> 31:20
> :   "We should have a box, let's call it 'moneybox'" (`M1`)

Now, the direction of the discussion moves to not only rationalisation through existing conceptualisations, but also novel ones. A succession of alternatives are proffered for consideration and shot down with varying amounts of reasoning. Finally, a transformation is achieved by calling out the need for an entirely new place to be putting work items in, thus giving rise to `MONEYBOX`. The secondary contradiction is resolved by the conceptualisation of a new kind of category, allowing the model to better reflect the team's understanding and intent. The act of coming up with a new category itself also serves to redefine the rules of a daily, supporting the use of such a problem solving pattern in the future.

The next fragment presents the team in the act of creating another new place for work items. In doing so, the team frames itself as a stakeholder in the equation of work organisation, and as being capable of declaring things being worthy of doing, of collecting work items to backlogs. Compared to the previous state of affairs this is an empowerment and an expansion of the team's capabilities. The team is beginning to graduate from yes/no, now/never classifier of input to a more nuance-capable actor.

#### Daily 16, `OUTBOX`

> 37:50
> :   "Do we some kind of list or ability to make a list of stuff that is not in [part of the platform] but should be?" (`M1`)
> :   "No, we don't have a list" (`D1`, dejected?)
<!-- > 38:03
> :   "But do we have the ability to make a list?" (`M1`) -->
> 38:06
> :   "Do we even know what these things [that are not part of the platform but should be] are?" (`M1`)
> 39:15
> :   "So where's the project?" (`M1`)
> :   "Would you like me to make one now?" (`D1`)
> :   "Wouldn't it make sense?" (`M1`)
> 39:35
<!-- > :   "What's the theme called?" -->
> :   "Can we have like 'module core' or something like that?" (`D2`)

We notice in this interaction that the team has resolved a latent contradiction which could be observed at a distance but did not come up in the discussion had in the daily `09` fragment. At that point in time, the team was not an entity that could 'need' something to be done, and the inability to model such a state of affairs reflected that fact. But now the question is, "wouldn't it make sense" to create a new thing to help document the state of need experienced by the team. The contradiction resolved is the fact of being unable to reflect that state of need in the model, and the resolution is to use the team's newfound powers to extend the model accordingly and create `MODULE CORE`.

### Facing the effects of new boards {#effects-of-new-boards}

It is after this point that the team needs to face the practical effects of having created new boxes. To have any kind of effect on outcomes, they need to be *used* in some way, and thus the team browses through `MONEYBOX` as part of the daily. The discussion is audibly confused, but uncharacteristically animated with people providing suggestions as almost interjections, as the team looks to interpret what it sees.

#### Daily 17, `MONEYBOX`

> 43:35
> :   "Moneybox!" (`D1`)
> 43:43
> :   "These are old things" (`M1`)
> 43:46
> :   "Let's shovel them somewhere [so] it says 'old things'" (`D2`)
> 43:49
> :   "Can we put the label..." (`D1`)
> :   "'Longstanding'?" (`D2`)
> 43:52
> :   "Waiting for money? Money required?" (`D1`)
> 44:05
> :   "We need an inbox here" (`D2`)

It's found that the `MONEYBOX` needs to be further refined to support the team's use of it in the daily. Recognizing this tertiary contradiction between the new part of practice and the existing practice of effectively going through work items, the team promptly resolves the problem by suggesting that new status labels be applied.

The next fragment finds the team rejecting a work item as reflecting an overly short-sighted approach. The team again doesn't seem to feel they have the right kind of board at hand for the work item. The 'new rules' of problem solving introduced in daily `16` also gradually start to set in: team members see new boxes as an option to take for inbox items.

#### Daily 18, `INBOX`

> 25:45
> :   "You know better what needs to be done, but we need to be building a platform" (`M1`)
> 25:55
> :   "So... we put this in the module backlog, but under a different description... or, wishlist, or..?" (`D1`, unsure which action to take as secretary)
> 26:10
> :   "What do we do?" (`D1`)
> :   "I don't know what we should do–" (`M1`)
> 26:25
> :   "Hey, this is a `MODULE CORE` thing, right?" (`D1`)

The situation surfaces a primary contradiction in that there appears to be a conflict between the need for holistic, long-term thinking and quick, one-off fixes. This is resolved by rejecting the initial plan of a one-off fix and rephrasing the related work item. A secondary contradiction also appears when the team is unable to find a place for the rephrased work item. The previously created `MODULE CORE` board is appropriated for this purpose, reconceptualizing it as being capable of admitting the work item. With this transformation in place the team continues satisfied with the outcome.

Another need related to longer term thinking presents itself in the same daily. The team identifies a work item that they identify as needing attention but which is not critical and which may not be taken action with at the moment. This time, the discussion takes a quick leap to the pattern of solutions applied before: would a new box be needed?

#### Daily 18, `OUTBOX`

> 35:46
> :   "So this is done?" (`M1`)
> :   "This is still an issue for this single app. Should we have some kind of [..] box?" (`D1`)
> 35:57
> :   "Or do we have a project [..]?" (`D1`)
> 36:17
> :   "Should we have a `WATBOX`? Because we have so many things that [..]" (`M1`)
> 36:36
> :   "That we can leave there and go them through like once a month. `WATBOX`, next to `MONEYBOX`." (`M1`)

The double bind of this situation can be described as follows: There's a need for following up on certain work items after an indeterminate amount of time. But if these items are left in `OUTBOX`, the team has to deal with them (e.g. by skipping) in every daily, which is undesirable. Proceeding to a secondary contradiction – on the other hand, if the items are not seen during the course of a daily, how would action ever be taken? The resolution is to not only have a `WATBOX`, but do decide on what is evidently a different treatment of that box as opposed to others so far.

### Newly created boards solidify as accepted practice {#new-boards-accepted}

The mere existence of a board affords the act of putting work items on it. That act, in the context of a daily, is collaborative and requires the development of a common understanding. The meaning of a board for the team comes into existence in a negotiation, where rationale for the use of a board is presented and either rejected or accepted. An example of such a negotiation occurs in daily `19`, when the placement of a work item in the `MONEYBOX` is challenged.

#### Daily 19, `INBOX`

<!-- > 15:40
> :   "So it's missing a case" (`M1`) -->
> 15:50
> :   "We don't have a use case" (`M1`)
> 15:55
> :   "Let's discuss this later" (`D1`)
> :   "Put it to the moneybox" (`D2`)
> :   "Or outbox if you want to continue the discussion" (`D3`)
> 16:02
> :   "I don't think this is a moneybox issue either" (`M1`)
> 16:07
> :   "I thought the moneybox function was that ... [there] are cases already" (`QA`)
> 16:13
> :   "No, but there have been indications already, this is an imaginary feature, and now we are waiting for somebody to say 'ok, we will pay x amount'–" (`M1`)

The contradiction is a secondary one, having to do with a recently introduced board and whether a new work item under discussion fits there. A transformation of the concept of `MONEYBOX` takes place, as a rationalization is presented and accepted – the situation is resolved by the work item becoming an example of an acceptable thing to be placing in the `MONEYBOX`.

A lot of noteworthy interactions happen in this very same daily. Next we'll find the team coming to grips with the use of a `MARKETING BOX`, introduced from the outside. The introduction bears relation to the previous agency-taking behavior of this team observed in daily `16`. The board itself belongs to a category of boards where stakeholdership of a work item is the determining factor: who is it that cares about the completion of this item?

#### Daily 19, `INBOX`

> 19:36
> :   "'Marketing will go through all the items in the wishlist and put them in... [`MARKETING BOX`]'?" (`D1` reading out loud)
> 19:42
> :   "Yes. So, we have this very very long wishlist. [...]" (`M1`)
<!-- I went this through with Marko and Harri that [Marketing] will go through all the items and put them to [`MARKETING BOX`]... -->
> 20:05
> :   "It's there, below `QUESTIONS`" (`M1`)
> :   "[Items in the wishlist] get a top 10 priority and the rest is still wishlist. So, just an announcement. [...]" (`M1`)
> 20:39
> :   "So, `OUTBOX`, longstanding" (`D2`)
> :   "Yeah, we need to see that this is ... [done]" (`M1`)

From the perspective of the other team, this interaction could reflect a quaternary contradiction between their new practice and this team's existing ones. We see that the team cares about whether the new practice starts working, and reflects this intent by modelling the situation as a work item in `OUTBOX`. The latter act may be taken as a step toward realigning the team's orientation and thus resolving the quaternary contradiction.

The themes of long-term planning and wishlists segmented by different stakeholders come together in the following fragment. The team identifies a step in the company's service delivery process that results in significant overhead and thus waste. However, the issue is not so serious as to be a fire, and the team believes a product owner prioritising a wishlist would not rate the problem as high as the team. How should the situation be modelled, if the desire is nevertheless to get the issue solved at the opportune time? The marketing team has their own wishlist - perhaps the tech team deserves the same treatment!

#### Daily 19, `INBOX`

> 23:05
> :   "What if we implement [improvement] [...] it's a huge overhead [having to do without]" (`M1`, motivates desire to act on problem)
> 23:19
> :   "Yes, huge amounts of waste" (`D1`, agreeing that there's a problem)
> 23:44
> :   "If it's not a fire then what [..] is it and [when is it] done if ever..?" (`M1`, putting to question how the development of a solution could be modelled)
> 23:56
> :   "Could we have a state between these cycles and fires?" (`M1`, suggesting a direction of improvement)
> :   "No..! *(laughter)* No." (`D2`)
> :   "Because currently if it's not a fire and it's not-" (`M1`, restating dichotomy in current model)
> 24:08
> :   "We could have a cloud continuum. But no-one would ever move anything in there." (`D3`, pointing out the need for a new kind of modelling)
> :   "Exactly. This kind of state that would be... It would be like the top ten of [our] input. Like marketing [..]" (`M1`, drawing parallel to marketing box)
> 24:27
> :   "Isn't priority lane..?" (`QA`, invoking another parallel)
> :   "Sure, but priotity lane means that we are doing it" (`M1`, motivating difference)
<!-- > :   "So let's make a tech 'top ten'" (`D3`, drawing from marketing box)
> :   "I think we should have this. Each group has their own wishlist, top 10" (`D4`) -->
<!-- > 24:45
> :   "We see that this is a huge waste. But we can't go and blindly implement everything." (`M1`) -->
<!-- > 24:54
> :   "Wouldn't this actually go to the *marketing* top ten?" (`D3`) -->
> 25:00
> :   "I made a wishing well for us, and ... this can go there." (`D1`)
> :   "To.. where?" (`M1`)
> :   "The tech wishing well that is right below marketing" (`M1`)
> 25:42
> :   "Ok, this was a good improvement." (`M1`)

The contradiction underlying this exchange lies in the conflicting needs of different stakeholders and the task of work item priority allocation to reconcile these differences. This is brought up through the identification of a wasteful process and the realisation of an inability to model the team's desire of completing the work item relating to improving that process. The team accepts that this might be resolved by improving their capability to model the situation, which may be taken as the identificiation of a secondary contradiction. As a transformation step, the team constructs the concept of a `TECH WISHING WELL`, taking parallels from `MARKETING BOX`.

The new `TECH WISHING WELL` board is quickly transformed into an accepted part of practice. The team finds that there are other new work items that might best be placed there.

#### Daily 19, `INBOX`

> 26:51
> :   "This [defect] is horrible. So could we instead of shoveling this to wishlist .. put this to the newly created wishing well?" (`M1`, breaking from previous norm)
> 27:42
> :   "So, when do we do this? Wishlist?" (`D1`, offering a resolution for a different issue)
> :   "Let's put this to the wishing well. Not wishlist." (`M1`, suggests again a break from norm)
> :   "Isn't this a wishlist thing?" (`D2`, challenges suggestion)
> :   "We are working on those right now, the push notifications" (`M1`, asserting wishlist is not the right board)
> 28:46
> :   "Can we put this to wishing well?" (`M1`)
> :   *(laughter)*
> :   "Let's see if everything gets put to [wishing well], let's see how this works out!" (`M1`)
> 28:55
> :   "I think [..] everything *we* create is going to wishing well" (`QA`)
> 29:00
> :   "Exactly [...] this is how the world works" (`M1`)

The practice of placing work items in the `TECH WISHING WELL` during `INBOX` is clearly in conflict with the wishlist-fire dichotomy that still comes up in the team members' questions, presenting a tertiary contradiction. This contradictory state is seemingly accepted with no other rationale besides desire to see what happens. Members remark that the lack of rationale will possibly lead to *everything* being placed in the `TECH WISHING WELL` as if it was the old wishlist by another name, with the implication that this would be an undesirable outcome. No explicit transformation follows, the contradiction remains unresolved.

At this point in time, the team has a total of four new boards to use as boxes to shovel inbox items to: `MONEYBOX`, `WATBOX`, `MARKETING BOX` and `TECH WISHING WELL`. In daily `17`, the team found they needed more structure for `MONEYBOX` to use it more effectively. In the following, the team makes additional findings regarding all of these mentioned boxes during a short "drive-through" by the driver and secretary.

#### Daily 19

> 45:33
> :   "Moneybox! ... Nothing new." (`D1`, as secretary)
> 45:37, `WATBOX`
> :   "Watbox!" (`D1`)
> :   "Watbox doesn't need to [be gone] through" (`M1`)
> 45:44
> :   "Maybe we should move watbox out" (`D1`)
> 46:20, `MARKETING BOX`
> :   "Is marketing already updated?" (`M1` rhetorically to driver)"
> :   "Yep, it's just my placeholders..." (`M1` pointing out there's no action to take)
> 46:33, `NON-CORE MODULE CONTINUUM`
> :   "Should we move tech wishing well elsewhere as well, if we don't want to go through it here? ... Moving it next to watbox." (`D1`)

The boxes come up during the regular course of the daily, but there is nothing to act upon. There's a primary contradiction between the need to spend less collective time on the daily and the thoroughness of inspecting and grooming boards, which is seen as dissatisfaction when a board is inspected but seemingly requires no action from the team. The addition of new boards has exacerbated this condition, bringing about a tertiary contradiction, which is resolved by the team by moving the virtual boards out of the way of the path the driver usually takes when facilitating the daily.

The final step of the transformational journey occurs in daily `20`, when the `TECH WISHING WELL` gets more things assigned. We can observe that the team members are now prepared to argue for and rationalise their choice of `TECH WISHING WELL` as the category for a specific work item.

#### Daily 20, `INBOX`

> 08:40
> :   "This [work item goes to the] tech wishing well?" (`D1`)
> :   "Yeah, because that was the middle stage between wishlist and fire" (`M1`)

> 19:27
> :   "So... this goes into wishlist I guess?" (`D2`, accompanied by collective sighing)
> 19:38
> :   "But isn't this about having centralized signout or something?" (`M1`, providing rationale against wishlist placement)
> :   "Yes but there's no business value [for implementing this in a specific way] so this should go to wishlist..." (`D2`, providing counter-rationale and restating suggestion)
> :   "Maybe this goes somewhere like the tech wishing well?" (`D3`, suggesting a better solution given the rationale)

Two new work items are processed which are considered to belong to `TECH WISHING WELL` board. The team discusses criteria for such items: “middle stage between wishlist and fire” and “no business value”. With the presentation and acceptance of these rationale, the meaning of `TECH WISHING WELL` is collaboratively constructed and affirmed. The tertiary contradiction between the previous state of practice and this new one is thus resolved and the use of the board may be seen to have become part of accepted practice for the team.

### Transformation summary

At the outset, the team had a way of dealing with `INBOX` items by segmenting them into urgent and non-urgent items. The first would be dealt with immediately, the latter shoveled to a wishlists which were to be handled ultimately with the means of a practice entirely separate from the daily. <!-- This division, although binary in the essential, was obscured to a degree by a separation of urgent items into technical and non-technical kinds (represented with `FIRES` and `PRIORITY LANE`) and a separation between wishlist items according to who would ostensibly be processing them later. --> It might be argued that the team was reluctant to make any kind of change due to these wishlists interfacing which other practices, which the daily and the team by themselves aren't empowered to change.

During the transformational journey the team arrives at the understanding that there are different levels of urgencies; different sets of priorities between stakeholders, including themselves; and ways of modelling both of these which are distinct from what the current modelling agrees with or makes possible to express.
