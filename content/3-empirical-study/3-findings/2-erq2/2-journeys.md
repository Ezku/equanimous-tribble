## Journeys of transformation {#journeys-of-transformation}

In the introductory section the usefulness of a daily was set to question by the fact that it is not a software development activity in itself. To reiterate, no features are delivered, no bugs fixed and no customer served. Therefore, if a use for the daily is to be found, in that it somehow aids software development activities, the use must lie in the relation between the daily and other practices that _do_ constitute software development. From the episodes found in the empirical data, a set was chosen such that their orientation is *not* toward the daily and what happens within but impactful on the outside world. The most important 'story arcs', if you will, were extracted from their original context and presented here compressed form such that we may observe the structural tensions reflected and their resolution via a process of transformation.
