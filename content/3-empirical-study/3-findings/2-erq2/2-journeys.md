## A transformational journey {#journey-of-transformation}

In the introductory section the usefulness of a daily was set to question by the fact that it is not a software development activity in itself. To reiterate, no features are delivered, no bugs fixed and no customer served. Therefore, if a use for the daily is to be found, in that it somehow aids software development activities, the use must lie in the relation between the daily and other practices that _do_ constitute software development.

From the episodes found in the empirical data, a set was chosen such that their orientation is *not* toward the daily and what happens within but impactful on the outside world. They were curated into journeys, episodes which appeared related through their contradictions and their transformations. In this section, we follow one of those journeys in depth. We're going to find out about what was discussed in \ref{structural-change}, segments which prominently appeared and then vanished at the latter part of the observation period.

The journey starts with the first time that the team can be observed to identify a problem with the way they handle inbox items. The standard procedure options apparent to the team are handling the new work item as either wishlist or fire. Here, they come across a work item that does not fit their conception of either. The item appears to the team as simultaneously less urgent than a fire yet more important than a wishlist item.

#### Daily 09, `INBOX`

> 05:10
> :   "Let's put this [new work item] on the 'required' list" (`D1`)
> 05:11
> :   "Okay, so... wishlist?" (`D2`)
<!-- > 05:16
> :   "Well..." (`D3`) -->
> 05:18
> :   "This is a funny thing to be putting on a wishlist" (`D2`)
> 05:18
> :   "But at least it's not a fire" (`D1`)

The team would not like to apply the standard procedures in place - either of them would be "a funny thing" to be doing. Taking note of this allows a latent primary contradiction to be surfaced. However, it is seen as merely a disturbance and no attempt at explanation or transformation follows: the resolution seems to be simply inaction, with the item left in the inbox for later. <!-- Is this true? -->

It takes a while for the issue to brew and mature. Five dailies (more than three weeks of calendar time) later we find the team discussing an outbox item which presents a similar conundrum. A work item appears which, paradoxically, will not need doing nor priorisation through wishlist until an additional external trigger.

#### Daily 14, `OUTBOX`

> 21:33
> :   "I guess wishlist or something would be appropriate?" (The presented alternative is rejected by silence.<!-- Is this true? -->)
> 22:05
> :   "Has it been through inbox?"
> :   "No. It's because that doesn't need to be done."

> 27:15
> :   "-- it's pending a project.. There's no case"
> :   "Can we throw this to [a release cycle]?"
> :   "No, we won't be doing it"

This time, instead of being satisfied with their declaration of an item being unfit for the apparent categories, the team does attempt to model the situation such that a suitable place could be found. The team's action demonstrates the existence and attempted resolution of a secondary contradiction, which goes as unresolved as the previous primary contradiction. Wherever the item is placed after this interaction, it's apparent the team isn't going to be satisfied. However, the team does clear one hurdle: now that the context of the discussion is `OUTBOX`, options other than wishlist and fire present themselves, and handling the work item as part of a release cycle is discussed.

The scope of possible options is further expanded in the next daily. A work item that was initially processed as a fire is identified as actually not requiring action. Reference is made to the item's similarity with the one from the previous fragment. The work item depends on an external party, but is not impeded. It is done for a client but the scope is the whole product platform, and it's a technical customer need, but doesn't need to be resolved immediately.

#### Daily 15, `FIRES`

> 29:05
> :   "So how many weeks until we need this?"
> 29:13
> :   "Is this like a non-core, pending for project thing?"
> 29:28
> :   "Why not move this to [a release cycle]?"
> 29:50
> :   "Do we have a project for [client]? Can it be there?"
> 30:40
> :   "Isn't it kind of priority lane? It's a customer need"
> 31:20
> :   "We should have a box, let's call it 'moneybox'"

Now, the direction of the discussion moves to not only rationalisation through existing conceptualisations, but also novel ones. Finally, a transformation is achieved by calling out the need for an entirely new place to be putting work items in, thus giving rise to `MONEYBOX`. The secondary contradiction is resolved by the conceptualisation of a new kind of category, allowing the model to better reflect the team's understanding and intent. The act of coming up with a new category itself also serves to redefine the rules of a daily, supporting the use of such a problem solving pattern in the future.

The next fragment presents the team in the act of creating another new place for work items. In doing so, the team frames itself as a stakeholder in the equation of work organisation, and as being capable of declaring things being worthy of doing, of collecting work items to backlogs. Compared to the previous state of affairs this is an empowerment and an expansion of the team's capabilities. The team is beginning to graduate from yes/no, now/never classifier of input to a more nuance-capable actor.

#### Daily 16, `OUTBOX`

> 37:50
<!-- > :   "Do we some kind of list or ability to make a list of stuff that's not in [part of the platform] but should be? Because that's a project"
> :   "No" -->
> :   "But do we have the ability to make a list? Do we even know what these things [that are not part of the platform but should be] are?"
> 39:20
> :   "Where's the project?"
> :   "Would you like me to make one now?"
> :   "Wouldn't it make sense?"
> 39:35
<!-- > :   "What's the theme called?" -->
> :   "Couldn't we have like 'module core' or something?"

We notice in this interaction that the team has resolved a latent contradiction which could be observed at a distance but did not come up in the discussion had in the daily `09` fragment. At that point in time, the team was not an entity that could 'need' something to be done, and the inability to model such a state of affairs reflected that fact. But now the question is, "wouldn't it make sense" to create a new thing to help document the state of need experienced by the team. The contradiction resolved is the fact of being unable to reflect that state of need in the model, and the resolution is to use the team's newfound powers to extend the model accordingly and create `MODULE CORE`.

It is at this point that the team needs to face the practical effects of having created new boxes. To have any kind of effect on outcomes, they need to be *used* in some way, and thus the team browses through `MONEYBOX` as part of the daily.

#### Daily 17, `MONEYBOX`

> 43:30
> :   "These are old things"
> :   "Let's shovel them somewhere so it says 'old things'"
> :   "Can we put the label 'longstanding'?"
> :   "Waiting for money? Money required?"
> :   "We need an inbox here"

It's found that the `MONEYBOX` needs to be further refined to support the team's use of it in the daily. Recognizing this tertiary contradiction between the new part of practice and the existing practice of effectively going through work items, the team promptly resolves the problem by suggesting that new status labels be applied.

The next fragment finds the team rejecting a work item as reflecting an overly short-sighted approach. The team again doesn't seem to feel they have the right kind of board at hand for the work item. The 'new rules' of problem solving introduced in daily `16` also gradually start to set in: team members see new boxes as an option to take for inbox items.

#### Daily 18, `INBOX`

> 25:45
> :   "You know better what needs to be done, but we need to be building a platform"
> :   "So we put this in the module backlog, but under a different description... or, wishlist, or..?"
<!-- > :   "What?" -->
> :   "What do we do?"
<!-- > :   "If there's a supersonic-and-frontend backlog" -->
<!-- > :   "I don't think so" -->
<!-- > :   "I don't know what we should do but I don't think we should do a task like that" -->
> 26:25
> :   "Hey, this is a `MODULE CORE` thing, right?"

The situation surfaces a primary contradiction in that there appears to be a conflict between the need for holistic, long-term thinking and quick, one-off fixes. This is resolved by rejecting the initial plan of a one-off fix and rephrasing the related work item. A secondary contradiction also appears when the team is unable to find a place for the rephrased work item. The previously created `MODULE CORE` board is appropriated for this purpose, reconceptualizing it as being capable of admitting the work item. With this transformation in place the team continues satisfied with the outcome.

Another need related to longer term thinking presents itself in the same daily. The team identifies a work item that they identify as needing attention but which is not critical and which may not be taken action with at the moment. This time, the discussion takes a quick leap to the pattern of solutions applied before: would a new box be needed?

#### Daily 18, `OUTBOX`

> 35:45
> :   "So this is done?"
> :   "This is still an issue for this single app"
> :   "Should we have some kind of [..] box? Or do we have a project [..]?"
> 36:15
> :   "Should we have a `WATBOX`? Because we have so many things that [..]"
> :   "That we can leave there and go them through like once a month. `WATBOX` goes next to `MONEYBOX`."

The double bind of this situation can be described as follows: There's a need for following up on certain work items after an indeterminate amount of time. But if these items are left in `OUTBOX`, the team has to deal with them (e.g. by skipping) in every daily, which is undesirable. Proceeding to a secondary contradiction – on the other hand, if the items are not seen during the course of a daily, how would action ever be taken? The resolution is to not only have a `WATBOX`, but do decide on what is evidently a different treatment of that box as opposed to others so far.

The mere existence of a board affords the act of putting work items on it. That act, in the context of a daily, is collaborative and requires the development of a common understanding. The meaning of a board for the team comes into existence in a negotiation, where rationale for the use of a board is presented and either rejected or accepted. An example of such a negotiation occurs in daily `19`, when the placement of a work item in the `MONEYBOX` is challenged.

#### Daily 19, `INBOX`

<!-- > 15:00
> :   "So it's missing a case" -->
> 16:50
> :   "I don't think this is a moneybox issue"
> :   "I thought the moneybox function is that ... there are cases already"
> :   "No, but there have been indications already, this is an imaginary feature, and now we are waiting for somebody to say 'we will pay x amount'..."

The contradiction is a secondary one, having to do with a recently introduced board and whether a new the work item under discussion fits there. A transformation of the concept of `MONEYBOX` takes place, as a rationalization is presented and accepted – the situation is resolved by the work item becoming an example of an acceptable thing to be placing in the `MONEYBOX`.


Marketing has a new board on which they want to reflect their own priority for product improvements.
Tracking the use of MARKETING BOX gets its own longstanding outbox item
Tertiary: reconciliation of new “MARKETING BOX” practice vs existing OUTBOX practice. Quaternary: realignment with practices of another team.


+ there's a new MARKETING (inbox?) where they will shovel and prioritize their top 10 things instead of having them hang around in wishlist where we can't act on them appropriately anyways

> 19:45
> :   "Marketing will read all the items in the wishlist and put them in... marketing?"
> :   "Yes, we have this very very long wishlist. I went this through with Marko and Harri that [Marketing] will go through all the items and put them to [marketing]... they'll get a top 10 priority and the rest is still wishlist... when there's top10 we can maybe take one off [the top]"
> :   "So, outbox, longstanding"
> :   "yeah, we need to see that this is ... [done]"





The team encounters a work item that describes an improvement which they do not think is a fire but that they themselves consider more important than a product owner prioritising the wishlist would.
TECH WISHING WELL created
Primary: conflicting needs of different stakeholders. Secondary: existing model does not allow reflecting stakeholders.

> :   "Could we have a state between these cycles and fires? Because currently if it's not a fire and it's not..."

> :   "Isn't priority lane..."

> :   "So let's make a tech lane then"
> :   "I think we should have this. Each group has their own wishlist, top 10"
> :   "We see that this is a huge waste. But we can't go and blindly implement everything."
> :   "Wouldn't this actually go to the marketing top ten?"
> 25:00
> :   "I made a wishing well for us and this can go there."
> :   "To where? The tech wishing well that is right below marketing"
> 25:40

=> creation of tech wishing well



The team encounters another work item which they think is more important than wishlist.

### Transformation summary

At the outset, the team had a way of dealing with `INBOX` items by segmenting them into urgent and non-urgent items. The first would be dealt with immediately, the latter shoveled to a wishlists which were to be handled ultimately with the means of a practice entirely separate from the daily. <!-- This division, although binary in the essential, was obscured to a degree by a separation of urgent items into technical and non-technical kinds (represented with `FIRES` and `PRIORITY LANE`) and a separation between wishlist items according to who would ostensibly be processing them later. --> It might be argued that the team was reluctant to make any kind of change due to these wishlists interfacing which other practices, which the daily and the team by themselves aren't empowered to change.

During the transformational journey the team arrives at the understanding that there are different levels of urgencies; different sets of priorities between stakeholders, including themselves; and ways of modelling both of these which are distinct from what the current modelling agrees with or makes possible to express.
