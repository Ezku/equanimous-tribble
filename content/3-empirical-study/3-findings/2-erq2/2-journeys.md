## A transformational journey {#journey-of-transformation}

In the introductory section the usefulness of a daily was set to question by the fact that it is not a software development activity in itself. To reiterate, no features are delivered, no bugs fixed and no customer served. Therefore, if a use for the daily is to be found, in that it somehow aids software development activities, the use must lie in the relation between the daily and other practices that _do_ constitute software development.

From the episodes found in the empirical data, a set was chosen such that their orientation is *not* toward the daily and what happens within but impactful on the outside world. They were curated into journeys, episodes which appeared related through their contradictions and their transformations. In this section, we follow one of those journeys in depth. We're going to find out about what was discussed in \ref{structural-change}, segments which prominently appeared and then vanished at the latter part of the observation period.
