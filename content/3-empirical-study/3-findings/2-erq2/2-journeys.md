## A transformational journey {#journey-of-transformation}

In the introductory section the usefulness of a daily was set to question by the fact that it is not a software development activity in itself. To reiterate, no features are delivered, no bugs fixed and no customer served. Therefore, if a use for the daily is to be found, in that it somehow aids software development activities, the use must lie in the relation between the daily and other practices that _do_ constitute software development.

From the episodes found in the empirical data, a set was chosen such that their orientation is *not* toward the daily and what happens within but impactful on the outside world. They were curated into journeys, episodes which appeared related through their contradictions and their transformations. In this section, we follow one of those journeys in depth. We're going to find out about what was discussed in \ref{structural-change}, segments which prominently appeared and then vanished at the latter part of the observation period.

<!-- The focus here is the transformation we observed earlier: where did moneybox, marketing box et al come from -->

#### Daily 09, `INBOX`

> 05:10
> :   "Let's put this [new work item] on the 'required' list" (`D1`)
> 05:11
> :   "Okay, so... wishlist?" (`D2`)
> 05:16
> :   "Well..." (`D3`)
> 05:18
> :   "This is a funny thing to be putting on a wishlist" (`D2`)
> 05:18
> :   "But at least it's not a fire" (`D1`)

#### Daily 14, `OUTBOX`

> 21:33
> :   "I guess wishlist or something would be appropriate?"
> 22:05
> :   "Has it been through inbox?"
> :   "No. It's because that doesn't need to be done."

> 27:15
> :   "-- it's pending a project.. There's no case"
> :   "Can we throw this to [release cycle] #23?"
> :   "No, we won't be doing it"

#### Daily 15, `FIRES`

> 29:05
> :   "So how many weeks until we need this?"
> 29:13
> :   "Is this like a non-core, pending for project thing?"
> 29:28
> :   "Why not move this to one of the releases for composer? [..]"
> 29:50
> :   "Do we have a project for [client]? Can it be there?"
> 30:40
> :   "Isn't it kind of priority lane? It's a customer need"
> 31:20
> :   "We should have a box, let's call it 'moneybox'"

The work item depends on an external party, but is not impeded. It is done for a client but the scope is the whole product platform. And it's a technical customer need, but doesn't need to be resolved immediately.

#### Daily 16, `OUTBOX`

> 37:50
> :   "Do we some kind of list or ability to make a list of stuff that's not in supersonic but should be? Because that's a project"
> :   "No"
> :   "But do we have the ability to make a list? Do we even know what these things are?"
> 39:20
> :   "Where's the project?"
> :   "Would you like me to make one now?"
> :   "Wouldn't it make sense?"
> 39:35
> :   "What's the theme called?"
> :   "Couldn't we have like 'module core' or something?"

#### Daily 17, `MONEYBOX`

> 43:30
> :   "These are old things"
> :   "Let's shovel them somewhere so it says 'old things'"
> :   "Can we put the label 'longstanding'?"
> :   "Waiting for money? Money required?"
> :   "We need an inbox here"

#### Daily 18, `INBOX`

> 25:45
> :   "You know better what needs to be done, but we need to be building a platform"
> :   "So we put this in the module backlog, but under a different description... or, wishlist, or..?"
> :   "What?"
> :   "What do we do?"
> :   "If there's a supersonic-and-frontend backlog"
> :   "I don't think so"
> :   "I don't know what we should do but I don't think we should do a task like that"
> 26:25
> :   "Hey, this is a module core thing, right?"


#### Daily 18, `OUTBOX`

> 35:45
> :   "So this is done?"
> :   "This is still an issue for this single app"
> :   "Should we have some kind of what-the-fuck box? Or do we have a project called what the fuck?"
> 36:15
> :   "Should we have a WATBOX? Because we have so many things that are not..."
> :   "That we can leave there and go them through like once a month. Watbox goes next to moneybox."
