# Data collection and analysis

## Research methodology {#research-methodology}

From December 2015 to January 2016, a period of time including a break for seasonal holidays, 20 individual daily events were observed and recorded. The time span was chosen both to get a representative sample of dailies and to allow for the potential discovery of a shift in the team's understanding of the system of work and the flow of work through the system.

The events observed were part of the everyday proceedings of the software development team. The team was informed beforehand of the intent to record the proceedings and that the intent would *not* be to interfere with what occurs naturally or deploy interventions for purposes of study. The author took part in all of these events and took the same role of secretary (as described in \ref{daily-roles}) in each one. The dailies took place in a meeting room that was fitted with a table, on which a mobile device was set for purposes of recording before the beginning of each daily.

Audio recordings consitute the primary data for this research, as defined in \ref{research-approach-and-scope}. After dailies, notes on what went on were made to accompany the recordings as basis for further analysis later. In addition to audio recordings and the accompanying notes, the kanban boards' structure was captured as screenshots from the virtual kanban board tool described in section \ref{daily-tools}. These notes and screenshots constitute secondary data which were used to validate and support understanding of primary data.

Audio recordings were transferred from the recording device, an *iPhone 5S*, as *mp4* files, and played back using *VLC Player*. An initial analysis and structuring of the material was carried out for each daily by first reviewing the associated notes as a clue on possible interesting events, features, or background information useful for understanding the proceedings and then playing back the audio in a linear fashion. Notes of the audio were made in text format, logging timestamps of discussion topics and interactions that were found to be of interest.

Capturing the kanban boards' structure as screenshots yielded material of two different kinds. The web software Asana described in \ref{daily-tools} presents what the researcher understood as kanban boards as a linear list. The contents of this list were extracted and are presented as indexes in appendix section \ref{kanban-board-lists}. The individual kanban boards' structure, expressed likewise as a linear list of labels or 'states', was extracted in a similar fashion and presented fully in appendix section \ref{kanban-board-structure}.

<!-- TODO: Visualisation of the two different kinds of structural data captured -->

The content log and board structures afforded the completion of a *segment analysis*, a coding process arriving at a structural outline of dailies which provided an understanding of broad patterns of activity as accorded with section \ref{research-approach-and-scope}. The segments will be further described in section \ref{durations-and-segments}. When attention to narrow episodic fragments was called for, they were transcribed individually in more accurate detail. Such transcriptions will be presented in this study following this convention:

Timestamp in minutes:seconds
:   "Speech in between quote marks" (with `attributions` in parentheses)
:   (descriptions, interpretations and characterisations of situation or action in parentheses)
:   "Omissions of fragments [..] and injections [of] missing parts of speech for understandability marked by square brackets"
Timestamp for next set of actions
:    (turns taken in continuous fashion can be transcribed under a single timestamp, but otherwise individual timestamps are presented)

The audio recordings were further reviewed with the aid of the content log to discover episodes of particular theoretical interest. Firstly, fragments of the content log were curated on new documents, one per each daily, as potentially pointing to interesting details. Then, the audio referenced in the content log fragment was reviewed and its relative importance within the body of material reconsidered by the researcher. Fragments found theoretically relevant were retained in the curated documents. Some fragments were seen to benefit from more in-depth understanding and were transcribed. The episode catalogue thus formed constituted material for analysis of disturbance episodes undertaken in section \ref{episodes-of-contradiction}.

The final part of the empirical analysis was enabled by a joining of the theoretical understanding of the importance and nature of transformational processes, expounded in \ref{activity-theory}, and the created episode catalogue. The episodes were further curated such that some of them could be linked to each other thematically by the researcher. Of the altogether 10 possible storylines identified, one was sampled for complete transcription and presentation in \ref{journey-of-transformation} on the basis of scope and importance to the team's daily activities.


## Overview of collected data

This section presents an outline on the data and its salient features. Table \ref{daily-overview} is introduced as a basis for reference. When specific dailies are discussed, their index number (from `01` to `20`) will be used.

Table: Overview of audio material on dailies by daily index number and date. *Recorded* is the duration of the audio recording. *Effective* is the duration of the part of the recording constituting the daily activities (see \ref{daily-segment-lengths}). *Attendance* is the number of participants present. \label{daily-overview}

### Attendance and language

The dailies gathered an attendance of three to ten participants. As table \ref{daily-overview} shows, there is a drop in attendance halfway through the observation period. This is attributable to national holidays and the associated vacation periods starting in a staggered fashion. The team's mean daily attendance during normal operation appears to be seven to eight participants (dailies `01` to `05` and `12` to `20`).

Attendees' overall roles in the team could be divided into four categories: *developers* working on the product directly, *quality assurance* responsible for testing the product and verifying that requirements are met, *product owners* capable of making backlog priorizations, and *management* whose opinion carries great weight in the way of conducting operations (such as the daily itself). Developers and quality assurance were by convention compelled to take part (at the absence of a good reason to the contrary), whereas product owners and management were not. Roles, e.g. that of product owner and management, may overlap; in this case the more situationally relevant label will be used per transcribed interaction.

For the sake of both succinctness and preservation of anonymity, when these roles are referred to in transcriptions the following labels will be used. `D` for developers, `QA` for quality assurance, `PO` for product owners, and `M` for management. Different people will be differentiated by suffixing the label with an index number, such that e.g. `D3` will refer to the third developer taking a turn of speech through the specific interaction. As a further anonymity preservation measure, indexes used are specific to the transcription fragment instead of being persistent over fragments.

Due to its international composition, the team handled most of the dailies in English, reverting to Finnish when team member attendance allowed for it. Seven out of the twenty dailies observed were conducted in Finnish (dailies `06` to `11`). When quotes originally in Finnish are presented in the empirical findings section, translations by the researcher are shown for accessibility.

### Durations and segments {#durations-and-segments}

The 20 dailies recorded altogether consist of a total of 11 hours, 59 minutes and 12 seconds of audio. According to the segment analysis, the recordings could be trimmed to a total effective duration of 11 hours, 33 minutes and 21 seconds constituting the entirety of what was considered as the daily activities. The average effective duration of a daily was 34 minutes and 40 seconds.

| Metric      |   | Effective |
|-------------|---|----------:|
| **Total**   |   |  11:33:21 |
| **Average** |   |  00:34:40 |

Table: Aggregate metrics of effective daily durations.

A total of 13 different daily segments were identified in the material. Unless otherwise specified, the segment is named by reference to a concrete instance of a board. Prominent examples include `INBOX` and `FIRES`. An overview of the segments is provided in the following.

Most dailies start with an `INTRO`. The `INTRO` is a segment where the team has engaged the daily but is not yet focused on any of the boards available. The segment can be prompted by a call such as *"So, general things"* (`01`, **02:02**), or it might begin more fluidly e.g. with a team member presenting a topic for discussion as in this exchange from daily `03`:

00:33
:   (unstructured discussion, indistinct background chatter)
:   "That's an awesome pear." (`D1` making deadpan comment, pointing out nothing useful is happening)
00:37
:   (the distinct sound of a fruit, supposedly said pear, being chewed)
00:39
:   "Should we have a new nickname for [team member]?" (`D2` presents a topic)

Some dailies include a `BOARD OVERVIEW`. In these segments, the focus is not on individual boards, but their overall status or health, relationships and priorities between them and the arrangement of them in the list of boards. Here's an example where a developer inquires after the purpose of colored labels used for different boards (daily `03`):

26:21
:   "What about.. are the, uh, colors?" (`D` asks question about boards seen on screen)
:   "Yellow is in QA. Purple has passed QA. Then there's grey that is in smoketest and, well, you won't probably ever see the blue because I.. blue means it's.. has been smoketested and I'll archive it any moment now." (`QA` explains their methods)

Most boards used in dailies were ones of persistent nature. They are not explicitly bound to dates or weeks or deployment cadences. `CYCLES` make an exception to this. They are boards that are numbered and constitute a bundle of shippable things. Boards labelled with the same number would be deployed together, and there are a multitude of them in use at the same time. As alluded to in the quote by *QA* above, the board for a specific cycle will vanish from sight by being archived after work in it has been completed. All of these were grouped together as `CYCLES`. Discussion generally involves *what is being worked on*, *by whom* and *when it will be completed*. An extract from daily `02` demonstrates how conceptions on progress of work and implications of handovers are negotiated in context of `CYCLES`:

12:58
:   "So, are you still going to make it by friday?" (QA prompts)
:   "Yes" (`D1` responds)
:   "Still confident" (`QA` confirms)
:   "Quite..." (`D2` interjects)
13:05
:   "I have to, I'm leaving on friday" (`D2` explains)
:   (laughter)
13:15
:   "So who will be fixing your stuff on monday when it gets to QA or tuesday when it gets to QA?" (`QA` expresses concern)

*Cycle* is the team's name for a single development cadence. It is used for sets of features that are completed in synchrony with each other and that cannot be shipped incrementally. The opposite of this is a *continuum*, evident in boards such as `NON-CORE MODULE CONTINUUM` and `NON-FUNCTIONAL CONTINUUM`. Work done here can generally be shipped to production immediately after completion.

The use and concrete nature of these segments is described more in depth in section \ref{typical-segments}. Table \ref{total-segment-lengths} shows a summary of the data. Complete tables of the daily segments observed can be found in appendix section \ref{daily-segment-lengths}.
