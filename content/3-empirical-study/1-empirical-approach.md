# Empirical study description

The researcher is interested in gaining a deep understanding of the practice of a daily as it occurs in the context of software development. The agile discourse has a history with ethnographically-inspired studies of agile practices \citep{robinson2007ethnographically,marchenko2008scrum}, and a similar empirical approach was chosen here. An ethnographical approach is specifically well suited for discovery of how practitioners behave within and use the practice under investigation. Given the choice of theoretical background where a sociological understanding of practice plays a significant role, and the desire to observe in context, not to interfere with and to improve, ethnography makes for a sound choice. In the sense that the research also considers parts of speech and specific manipulations of cognitive artefacts as constitutive of knowledge co-creation, the empirical study also carries microethnographical tones \citep{streeck2005microethnography}.

## Research context

The research was conducted as a case study of a Helsinki-based software startup in the mobile B2B industry with a headcount of approximately 20 people and a development team consisting of at most 10 at the time of the research. The development team's habit of gathering around a collection of virtual kanban boards every morning was taken as an opportunity to learn about the practice of dailies as exercised within the context of a lean workflow. The researcher took part in the development team's dailies wearing two hats: the ordinary team member hat, which necessitated normal interaction with the team within the context of the daily, and a researcher hat which involved making observations and logging the proceedings.

## Setting and participants

### Environment

The chronological context of the development team daily was after a short whole-company standup meeting scheduled to start at 10 in the morning every day. The discussion from the standup meeting would sometimes anecdotally have an impact on the content of the development team daily, but expanding on this relation was not part of the research objectives.

The daily meetings were invariably held in a meeting room equipped with a table, a couch, a TV screen to which laptop computers could be plugged to, and two whiteboards. Attendees would customarily be seated for the duration of the daily. There was not enough room for more than 8 people to sit, so in the case of meetings which more than that amount attended, some would be forced to stand or choose to sit on the floor. On the table, two people would have their laptops open: the *driver* and the *secretary*.

### Roles {#daily-roles}

The driver connects their laptop to the TV screen, enabling the team to view the virtual kanban boards and items therein. Throughout the daily the driver will switch between kanban boards and task items according to how the team's discussion proceeds.

The secretary affects decisions made by the team. This can take the form of manipulating tasks on the boards, making modifications to board structure, and making meeting notes.

The driver and the secretary are the only explicit roles defined in the context of the daily. Other than that, the participants consist of developers, quality assurance, technical leads and product owners. All of the development team, including quality assurance but not necessary technical leads, were compelled to take part by convention. Product owners were present sporadically.

### Tools used {#daily-tools}

The most important tool made use of was Asana, a web-based task management application. It views work as *projects*, which consist of *tasks* in a linear list, which can be delineated into segments with *labels*. Tasks consist of a title and a description, may be assigned to individuals, may be given tags, and may be commented on. The daily relied on Asana as a virtual kanban board tool. The projects are understood as *boards*, and the labels are understood as *states* that a task can have.

In addition, meeting minutes were published through Flowdock, a company-internal instant messaging and group chat application. The application structures communication in terms of *flows*, under which participants may converse textually. One of these flows was dedicated for meeting minutes, so that there was usually no other discussion besides what was logged by the secretary.
