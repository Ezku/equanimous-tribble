# Empirical research questions

The following research questions are posed to the empirical research data.

> **ERQ1**: How is the organisation's system of work as understood by the individual team members manifested in the daily practice?

> **ERQ2**: How does the daily practice support co-creation of knowledge?

The first question is aimed at discovering whether the daily practice in fact constitutes the use and manipulation of the system of work as a shared conceptual artefact. The second question is for analyzing the role of the daily practice as an organisational mechanism for knowledge co-creation.
