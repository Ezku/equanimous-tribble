The following research questions are posed to the empirical research data.

> **ERQ1**: How does the daily practice reflect the activity system as understood by the team?

> **ERQ2**: How does the exercise of a daily improve upon the daily practice itself?

> **ERQ3**: How does the daily practice interact with other software development practices?

The first question concerns the team's understanding of the activity system that the daily practice is embedded in. We would like to observe how the activity system appears within the daily. How does the sociomaterial context of the daily support the conceptualization of the activity system?

The second question considers the "practice-nature" of the daily. When the team engages in a daily, does it evolve? How is the logic of action redefined â€“ can we see emerging disturbances to the activity system being settled within the daily?

With the third question we probe the boundaries of the daily practice and attempt to discover its interfaces with other practices identifiable in the exercise of software development. Can we see if the daily somehow informs other practices or aids in their execution?

The undertaking is, altogether, to show that the activity system plays a role in the daily, that the daily serves to improve on the team's understanding of the activity system and that this understanding is linked to the exercise of creating software. Should we succeed, we will be able to point to the use of a daily residing within this continually developing understanding of the activity system, or put more simply, *improving on how the work works*.
