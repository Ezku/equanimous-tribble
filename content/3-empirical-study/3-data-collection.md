# Data collection and analysis

## Research methodology

The data for this research was collected through the use of audio recordings. The events observed were part of the everyday proceedings of the software development team. The team was informed beforehand of the intent to record the proceedings and that the intent would not be to interfere with what occurs naturally or deploy interventions for purposes of study. The author took part in all of these events and took the same role of secretary and facilitator (as described in \ref{setting-and-participants}) in each one. The dailies took place in a meeting room that was fitted with a table, on which a mobile device was set for purposes of recording before the beginning of each daily. Notes on what went on in each daily were made to accompany the recordings as basis for further analysis later. In addition to audio recordings, visual samples of the kanban boards' structure were captured at times when changes to it were called for in the daily.

## Overview of collected data

From December 2015 to January 2016, a period of time including a break for seasonal holidays, 20 individual dailies were observed and recorded. The duration was chosen both to get a representative sample of dailies and to allow for the potential discovery of a shift in the team's understanding of the system of work and the flow of work through the system. It was initially hypothesised that this change would most concretely be exemplified in the virtual kanban boards' structure.

The 20 dailies recorded altogether contain a total of 11 hours, 59 minutes and 12 seconds of audio. Average duration for a daily was 35 minutes and 58 seconds, with a minimum at 11 minutes 57 seconds and a maximum at 1 hour 21 seconds. Readily it can be observed that these dailies were not conformant to the Scrum-espoused ideal of a maximum of *15 minutes* per daily.
