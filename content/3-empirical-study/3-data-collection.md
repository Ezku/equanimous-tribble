# Data collection and analysis

## Research methodology

The data for this research was collected through the use of audio recordings. The events observed were part of the everyday proceedings of the software development team. The team was informed beforehand of the intent to record the proceedings and that the intent would not be to interfere with what occurs naturally or deploy interventions for purposes of study. The author took part in all of these events and took the same role of secretary and facilitator (as described in \ref{setting-and-participants}) in each one. The dailies took place in a meeting room that was fitted with a table, on which a mobile device was set for purposes of recording before the beginning of each daily. Notes on what went on in each daily were made to accompany the recordings as basis for further analysis later.
