# Empirical approach

- Ethnographically-inspired studies of agile practices have been undertaken before \citep{robinson2007ethnographically,marchenko2008scrum} and similar approaches would seem valid in this context
- Microethnography \citep{streeck2005microethnography} sounds like a suitable empirical lens considering that we are interested in seeing if and how speech and manipulation of cognitive artefacts might yield knowledge on the problem of processes and work organization
