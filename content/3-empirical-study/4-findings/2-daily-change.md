# To change a daily

In the previous section we looked into how a daily happens and what kinds of activities a daily constitutes. We were left with the open question of *change*. If the daily is to be considered a practice, engaging in a daily should somehow inform the next occasions this engagement is taken and manifest as observable change in the practice. In this section we will lay the ground for answering **ERQ2** by investigating whether and how this change happens. Is there a structure to the change, does it happen by deliberation, or is it perhaps emergent and not premeditated?
