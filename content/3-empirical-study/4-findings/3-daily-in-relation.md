# The daily and other practices

In the introductory section I questioned the usefulness of a daily by the fact that it is not a software development activity in itself. To reiterate, no features are delivered, no bugs fixed and no customer served. Therefore, if a use for the daily is to be found, in that it somehow aids software development activities, the use must lie in the relation between the daily and other practices that _do_ constitute software development. In order to set the stage for answering **ERQ3**, in this section we investigate the interface between the daily and other practices.
