# Empirical study description

## Research context

The research was conducted as a case study of a Helsinki-based software startup in the mobile B2B industry with a headcount of approximately 20 people and a development team consisting of at most 10 at the time of the research. The development team's habit of gathering around a collection of virtual kanban boards every morning was taken by the researcher as an opportunity to learn about the practice of dailies as exercised within the context of a lean workflow. The researcher took part in the development team's dailies wearing two hats: the ordinary team member hat, which necessitated normal interaction with the team within the context of the daily, and a researcher hat which involved recording the proceedings and logging observations directly after the event.

## Setting and participants

### Environment

The development team daily occurred every day after a short whole-company standup meeting scheduled to start at 10 in the morning. The context of the observed dailies was a meeting room equipped with a table, a couch, a TV screen to which laptop computers could be plugged to, and two whiteboards. Attendees would customarily be seated for the duration of the daily. There was not enough room for more than 8 people to sit, so in the case of meetings which more than that amount attended, some would be forced to stand or choose to sit on the floor. On the table, two people would have their laptops open: the *driver* and the *secretary*.

### Roles {#daily-roles}

The driver and the secretary are the only explicit roles defined in the context of the observed daily.

The driver connects their laptop to the TV screen, enabling the team to view the virtual kanban boards and items therein. Throughout the daily the driver will switch between kanban boards and task items according to how the team's discussion proceeds. Usually, the driver will walk the team through boards and their work items in the order that they appear in. The team might make callouts and request that the driver deviate from this, and if the team's discussion diverges to a work item not currently shown the driver will attempt to accommodate.

The secretary affects decisions made by the team. This can take the form of manipulating tasks on the boards, making modifications to board structure, and making meeting notes.

### Tools used {#daily-tools}

The most important tool made use of was Asana, a web-based task management application in which the team had encoded their workflow. It views work as *projects*, which consist of *tasks* in a linear list, which can be delineated into segments with *labels*. Tasks consist of a title and a description, may be assigned to individuals, may be given tags, and may be commented on. The workflow was modelled with the use of projects and labels, which allowed the team to delineate different kinds of sub-workflows and the process steps that the workflows entailed.

In addition, meeting minutes were published through Flowdock, a company-internal instant messaging and group chat application. The application structures communication in terms of *flows*, under which participants may converse textually. One of these flows was dedicated for meeting minutes, so that there was usually no other discussion besides what was logged by the secretary.

Tools for sharing knowledge in the physical environment, such as post-its or the whiteboard present in the room, were seldom touched.
